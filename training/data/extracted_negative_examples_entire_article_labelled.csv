Limpopo police launch manhunt following illegal hunting of elephant and vulture poisoning ...,https://www.saps.gov.za/newsroom/msspeechdetail.php?nid=60801,,"Media Statement South African Police Service Office of the Provincial Commissioner Limpopo POLOKWANE - The police in Limpopo have launched an intensive manhunt for suspects responsible for the illegal hunting of an elephant and subsequent poisoning that resulted in the death of numerous protected vultures in the Kruger National Park. According to reports, on 8 May 2025, Phalaborwa SAPS received a report of an elephant carcass discovered in the Mushiyani block Mahlangeni area of the Kruger National Park. Initial investigations revealed that poachers used a cable snare to trap the elephant and then laced the carcass with poison. This toxic act caused devastating consequences when vultures fed on the contaminated carcass. Tragically, 123 vultures were found dead at the scene. A further 86 poisoned vultures were rescued and taken to a rehabilitation center in Hoedspruit for treatment. Despite rehabilitation efforts, one of the rescued vultures succumbed on 9 May 2025, bringing the death toll to 124, with 85 still receiving care. It was noted that both tusks on the elephant were still intact, suggesting the poachers may have been disturbed before they could remove them. The Provincial Commissioner of Police in Limpopo, Lieutenant General Thembi Hadebe, has strongly condemned this heinous act of wildlife crime. ""We are appalled by this senseless killing of our protected wildlife. Not only was an elephant illegally hunted, but the deliberate poisoning has resulted in significant damage to our vulture population, which plays a crucial role in our ecosystem,"" said Lieutenant General Hadebe. “We have assembled a dedicated team to track down these perpetrators and bring them to justice. This type of environmental crime threatens our natural heritage and will not be tolerated,” added Lieutenant General Thembi Hadebe. Lieutenant General Thembi Hadebe has appealed to members of the community who might have information regarding the whereabouts of the suspects to come forward. The public is encouraged to contact the Investigating Officer, Warrant Officer Eric Nkuna, at 082 657 7297, call the Crime Stop number 08600 10111, visit their nearest Police Station, or use the MySAPS App to report information.

In a somber ceremony attended by thousands, the victims were buried in a mass grave at their home in Upanda village, Sigomere sub-location. As mourners gathered, family, friends, and relatives of the deceased pleaded for justice for their loved ones. Leaders who attended the burial ceremony at Ninga Primary School grounds, equally called upon the government to ensure that those responsible for the heartbreaking tragedy are swiftly brought to justice. Siaya Deputy Governor William Oduol, alongside Ugunja politicians Otieno Alur and Eng. Fred ZB Owino, urged patience to allow investigative agencies to conclude their probe effectively. Mr. Alur encouraged residents to remain vigilant and report individuals exhibiting suspicious behavior. He emphasized that such a tragedy could have been prevented through stronger community ties. In a heartbreaking tribute, dozens of children carrying wreaths bid farewell to their classmates, singing sorrowful hymns and reciting poems before placing the wreaths on the nine white coffins, each adorned with a photograph of the deceased. The victims, a father, mother, and their seven children, aged between six months and 17 years perished on 22nd April 2024 when their home was set ablaze by unknown individuals, allegedly over a land dispute. < PREVIOUS ARTICLEGov’t to pay KSh150 billion owed to suppliers by end of 2025, President Ruto announces NEXT ARTICLE >Jumwa demands apology over ‘evil spirits’ remark — Threatens legal action Trending Now Uncategorized . 28 minutes ago CS Murkomen announces major reshuffle in Interior Ministry Interior Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen has made some changes in his Ministry.

Then he took an internship that ignited his passion for petroleum engineering and established him as a department leader. Nine-year-old Ivory Villegas peered up at the Spanish Renaissance architecture of Texas Tech University. Freshly moved from the small town of Denver City, Texas, surrounded by oil fields, he had never seen such beautiful buildings as he did when he tagged alongside his mom to her accounting job on campus. She would give him a tour of sorts enroute to her office, explaining the different colleges and dormitories they passed. Ivory hungrily took it all in, awestruck by the hustle and bustle of backpack-clad students striding to class. “Texas Tech became a huge part of our lives,” he recalled. “I knew for a fact that I wanted to be a part of it.” Throughout the changes from an adolescent to teenager to young adult, Ivory never swayed from his university of choice. He proudly wore the Double T every chance he got, daydreaming about becoming a Red Raider with his friends.

Is Ivory Coast's red card politics an own goal for democracy after Tidjane Thiam's ban - BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly8y1kglkpo,2025-05-08,"As an opponent of the ruling Rally of Houphouëtists for Democracy and Peace (RHDP), he offered Ivorian voters the chance to change their government. Yet with his centrist politics and solid technocratic credentials, his candidacy offered reassuring competence and the prospect of continuing the impressive economic progress that Ouattara has piloted since 2011. Now that potential trajectory is blocked. If the court decision stands - and Ivorian law offers no option of appeal for this particular issue - Thiam will be out of October's contest. It is a race from which past court convictions have already excluded three other prominent opposition figures - former President Laurent Gbagbo, former Prime Minister Guillaume Soro and a former minister, Charles Blé Goudé - all central actors in the political crises and civil conflicts that brutally paralysed the progress of Ivory Coast between 1999 and 2011. The prospect now is that Ouattara or any chosen RHDP successor candidate will approach the election without facing any heavyweight political challenge. That can only deepen Ivorians' already widespread popular disillusionment with the country's political establishment. This is against the wider context of a West Africa where the radical anti-politics rhetoric of the soldiers who have seized power in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger already finds a sympathetic audience among many disenchanted young people. That really matters in societies where, typically, three-quarters of the population is under 35.",1512,True,0
Ivory Coast Mid-Crop Concerns Underpin Cocoa Prices - The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/commodities/CTV23/pressreleases/32268803/ivory-coast-mid-crop-concerns-underpin-cocoa-prices/,2025-05-07,"July ICE NY cocoa (CCN25) Wednesday closed up +273 (+3.06%), and July ICE London cocoa #7 (CAN25) closed up +252 (+3.91%). Cocoa prices on Wednesday added to Tuesday's sharp gains, with NY cocoa posting a 1-week high and London cocoa posting a 1-month high. Coffee prices rallied on auality concerns regarding the Ivory Coast mid-crop, which is currently being harvested. Cocoa processors are complaining about the crop's quality and have rejected truckloads of Ivory Coast cocoa beans. Processors said about 5% to 6% of the mid-crop cocoa in each truckload is poor quality, compared with 1% during the main crop. According to Rabobank, the poor qualify of the Ivory Coast's mid-crop is tied in part to late-arriving rain in the region that limited crop growth. The mid-crop is the smaller of two annual cocoa harvests, which typically starts in April. The average estimate for this year's Ivory Coast mid-crop is 400,000 MT, down -9% from last year's 440,000 MT. On April 25, NY cocoa posted a 2-1/2 month high on supply concerns as the pace of Ivory Coast cocoa exports has slowed. Monday's government data showed that Ivory Coast farmers shipped 1.53 MMT of cocoa to ports this marketing year from October 1 to May 3, up +11.7% from last year but down from the much larger +35% increase seen in December. Last Wednesday, cocoa prices fell to 2-week lows on demand concerns. Chocolate maker Hershey Co. reported that Q1 sales fell -14% and said it anticipates $15-$20 million of tariff costs in Q2, which will boost chocolate prices and further weigh on consumer demand. Also, Mondelez International reported weaker-than-expected Q1 sales and said consumers are cutting back on snack purchases due to economic uncertainty and high chocolate prices. A rebound in current cocoa inventories is bearish for prices. Since falling to a 21-year low of 1,263,493 bags on January 24, ICE-monitored cocoa inventories held in US ports have rebounded and climbed to a 7-1/4 month high Wednesday of 2,107,210 bags. Cocoa prices also see negative carryover from Bloomberg's report last Monday that showed Nigerian Mar cocoa exports rose +24% y/y to 27,564 MT. Nigeria is the world's fifth-largest cocoa producer. Cocoa prices also have a positive carryover from recent news that showed better-than-expected global cocoa demand. Q1 North American cocoa grindings fell -2.5% y/y to 110,278 MT, better than expectations of at least a -5% y/y fall. Also, Q1 European cocoa grindings fell -3.7% y/y to 353,522 MT, a smaller decline than expectations for a -5% y/y drop. In addition, Q1 Asian cocoa grinding fell -3.4% y/y to 213,898 MT, a smaller decline than expectations for a fall of at least -5% y/y. Concern that consumer demand for cocoa and cocoa products will decline as the global trade war escalates and tariffs boost already-high cocoa prices is a bearish factor for cocoa. On April 10, Barry Callebaut AG, one of the world's biggest chocolate makers, cut its annual sales guidance in the face of high cocoa prices and tariff uncertainty. In a bearish factor, the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) on February 28 forecasted a global cocoa surplus of 142,000 MT for 2024/25, the first surplus in 4 years. ICCO also projected that 2024/25 global cocoa production will rise +7.8% y/y to 4.84 MMT. Smaller cocoa supplies from Ghana, the world's second-biggest cocoa producer, are supportive for prices after Cocobod, Ghana's cocoa regulator, cut its Ghana 2024/25 cocoa harvest forecast in December for the second time this season to 617,500 MT, down -5% from an August estimate of 650,000 MT. The ICCO, on February 28, said the 2023/24 global cocoa deficit was -441,000 MT, the largest deficit in over 60 years. ICCO said 2023/24 cocoa production fell -13.1% y/y to 4.380 MMT. ICCO said the 2023/24 global cocoa stocks/grindings ratio was 27.0%, a 46-year low. All market data (will open in new tab) is provided by Barchart Solutions. Copyright © 2025.

Photo: Cormac McCrimmon, Rocky Mountain PBSCOMMERCE CITY, Colo. — Elisa Dahlberg sliced through packing tape and flung open a box the size of an Eastern Lowland Gorilla. Inside lay dozens of purses made from caiman, stingray and other protected species, each containing a tag and evidence sticker. Special agents seized the handbags from a South American smuggling operation, said Dahlberg, the lead biologist and collections manager at the National Wildlife Property Repository, located on the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge. The warehouse is the final resting place for over 1.2 million illegal wildlife products confiscated during investigations, seized at ports of entry or abandoned by their owners. Inside the warehouse, taxidermied lions, tigers and bears stand frozen in time. Cobra boots seem to hiss from the shelves. Bear teeth, lion claws and elephant ivory fill buckets. Video: Cormac McCrimmon, Rocky Mountain PBSThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports that 4,000 precious wildlife species still fall prey to trafficking every year. Illicit wildlife trade is valued between $7.8 billion and $10 billion per year, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society.As climate change worsens, the UNODC warns that “Wildlife trafficking can disrupt delicate ecosystems and their functions, particularly undermining their ability to mitigate climate change.” Originally housed alongside the National Wildlife Forensics Lab in Ashland, Oregon, the property repository moved to Denver in the 1990s. The building once housed vehicles used to clean up the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, which served as a chemical weapons plant during World War II. Although not hermetically sealed, the building offers stable conditions to store items. Thieves attempted to rob the warehouse several years ago, said Dahlberg. When employees at the National Wildlife Property Repository receive a shipment, they often don’t know the items’ backstories.

Despite renouncing his French nationality in March to comply with election requirements, the court ruled his candidacy invalid. Referencing the 1961 nationality code, he said, ""An Ivorian national of full age who voluntarily acquires or states that he possesses a foreign nationality shall lose Ivorian nationality."" In the BBC interview, he claimed the government's decision to disqualify him is politically motivated and an abuse of the legal system, reiterating his right as a true-born Ivorian. Despite renouncing his French nationality in March to comply with election requirements, the court ruled Tidjane Thiam's candidacy invalid Tidjane Thiam dénonce la gouvernance du régime Ouattara lors de son premier meeting à Soubré Pulse Côte d'Ivoire ""The bottom line is, I was born an Ivorian,"" he said, adding, ""It's not for the regime to choose who runs opposition parties; it's not for the regime to eliminate opposition leaders."" “I don’t think anybody in the Ivory Coast believes that this is not a weaponization of the legal system by the government.” He stated. However, his claims were rejected by Ivory Coast's Information Minister, Amadou Coulibaly, who told the BBC that ""The court ruled that at the time he was registered on the electoral list, he was not Ivorian."" ""This is clear proof that this gentleman does not know Ivory Coast... We have a problem with morality regarding Mr. Thiam; he knew he was wrong,"" he added. Thiam will face a legal challenge to his candidacy, with courts expected to rule next Thursday. All parliamentary activity has been suspended in protest at his disqualification. His supporters, however, remain hopeful that he could be readmitted as a candidate. The final electoral list for October's election is to be published on June 20.",2735,True,0

Cocoa Prices Supported by Ivory Coast Mid-Crop Quality Issues - The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/commodities/SBN22/pressreleases/32189801/cocoa-prices-supported-by-ivory-coast-mid-crop-quality-issues/,2025-05-02,"July ICE NY cocoa (CCN25) Friday closed up +134 (+1.53%), and July ICE London cocoa #7 (CAN25) closed down -43 (-0.67%). Cocoa prices on Friday settled mixed. Cocoa prices are supported by quality concerns over the Ivory Coast mid-crop, which is currently being harvested. Cocoa processors are complaining about the crop's quality and have rejected truckloads of Ivory Coast cocoa beans. Processors said about 5% to 6% of the mid-crop cocoa in each truckload is poor quality, compared with 1% during the main crop. On Wednesday, cocoa prices fell to 1-week lows on demand concerns. Chocolate maker Hershey Co. reported that Q1 sales fell -14% and said it anticipates $15-$20 million of tariff costs in Q2, which will boost chocolate prices and further weigh on consumer demand. Also, Mondelez International reported weaker-than-expected Q1 sales and said consumers are cutting back on snack purchases due to economic uncertainty and high chocolate prices. Cocoa prices are also seeing negative carryover from Bloomberg's report on Monday that Nigerian Mar cocoa exports rose +24% y/y to 27,564 MT. Nigeria is the world's fifth-largest cocoa producer. A rebound in current cocoa inventories is bearish for prices. Since falling to a 21-year low of 1,263,493 bags on January 24, ICE-monitored cocoa inventories held in US ports have rebounded and climbed to a 7-month high Friday of 2,076,132 bags. Last Friday, NY cocoa posted a 2-1/4 month high on supply concerns as the pace of Ivory Coast cocoa exports has slowed. Monday's government data showed that Ivory Coast farmers shipped 1.5 MMT of cocoa to ports this marketing year from October 1 to April 27, up +12% from last year but down from the much larger +35% increase seen in December. Cocoa prices also have a positive carryover from recent news that showed better-than-expected global cocoa demand. Q1 North American cocoa grindings fell -2.5% y/y to 110,278 MT, better than expectations of at least a -5% y/y fall. Also, Q1 European cocoa grindings fell -3.7% y/y to 353,522 MT, a smaller decline than expectations for a -5% y/y drop. In addition, Q1 Asian cocoa grinding fell -3.4% y/y to 213,898 MT, a smaller decline than expectations for a fall of at least -5% y/y. Concern about the Ivory Coast's upcoming mid-crop is underpinning cocoa prices. According to Rabobank, late-arriving rains in the region have limited crop growth, and recent cocoa farmer surveys from the Ivory Coast and Ghana have been disappointing. The mid-crop is the smaller of two annual cocoa harvests, which typically starts this month. The average estimate for this year's Ivory Coast mid-crop is 400,000 MT, down -9% from last year's 440,000 MT. Last month, NY cocoa fell to a 1-month low, and London cocoa dropped to a 5-month low due to concern that consumer demand for cocoa and cocoa products will decline as the global trade war escalates and tariffs boost already-high cocoa prices. On April 10, Barry Callebaut AG, one of the world's biggest chocolate makers, cut its annual sales guidance in the face of high cocoa prices and tariff uncertainty. In a bearish factor, the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) on February 28 forecasted a global cocoa surplus of 142,000 MT for 2024/25, the first surplus in 4 years. ICCO also projected that 2024/25 global cocoa production will rise +7.8% y/y to 4.84 MMT. Smaller cocoa supplies from Ghana, the world's second-biggest cocoa producer, are supportive for prices after Cocobod, Ghana's cocoa regulator, cut its Ghana 2024/25 cocoa harvest forecast in December for the second time this season to 617,500 MT, down -5% from an August estimate of 650,000 MT. The ICCO, on February 28, said the 2023/24 global cocoa deficit was -441,000 MT, the largest deficit in over 60 years. ICCO said 2023/24 cocoa production fell -13.1% y/y to 4.380 MMT. ICCO said the 2023/24 global cocoa stocks/grindings ratio was 27.0%, a 46-year low. All market data (will open in new tab) is provided by Barchart Solutions. Copyright © 2025.

He added that an investigation is currently underway involving forest officials, veterinary experts, and law enforcement agencies to gather evidence and determine the exact circumstances surrounding the suspected poaching incident.“The male elephant’s tusks were found missing, and the cause of death is suspected to be poaching. An investigation is currently underway involving forest officials, veterinary experts, and law enforcement agencies to gather evidence and determine the exact circumstances surrounding the suspected poaching incident. A detailed post-mortem examination has been conducted, and the area has been thoroughly searched for clues such as footprints, vehicle tracks, or tools used in the crime. Intelligence networks have been activated, and local communities and informants are being engaged to provide any leads,” Dr Ramesh said. Check-posts have been alerted, and coordination with neighbouring forest divisions has been established to prevent the escape of suspects. All efforts are being made to swiftly identify and apprehend those responsible and bring them to justice,” Dr Ramesh added.He further said that, on the same day, another carcass of a female elephant was found in a stream near the Bonsom area of Panbari Range. “The cause of death in this case has been determined to be natural, due to old age,” Dr Ramesh said.The locations were inspected by the PCCF (Wildlife) and Chief Wildlife Warden Dr. Vinay Gupta, Council Head of Department (Forests) of Bodoland Territorial Council Suman Mahopatra, along with the Director of Manas Tiger Reserve Dr. C.

In a bearish factor, the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) on February 28 forecasted a global cocoa surplus of 142,000 MT for 2024/25, the first surplus in 4 years. ICCO also projected that 2024/25 global cocoa production will rise +7.8% y/y to 4.84 MMT. Smaller cocoa supplies from Ghana, the world's second-biggest cocoa producer, are supportive for prices after Cocobod, Ghana's cocoa regulator, cut its Ghana 2024/25 cocoa harvest forecast in December for the second time this season to 617,500 MT, down -5% from an August estimate of 650,000 MT. ICCO on February 28 said the 2023/24 global cocoa deficit was -441,000 MT, the largest deficit in over 60 years. ICCO said 2023/24 cocoa production fell -13.1% y/y to 4.380 MMT. ICCO said the 2023/24 global cocoa stocks/grindings ratio was 27.0%, a 46-year low. All market data (will open in new tab) is provided by Barchart Solutions. Copyright © 2025.

""The bottom line is, I was born an Ivorian,"" he told the BBC.The government said that at the time he registered on the electoral roll he was not legally a citizen of Ivory Coast.Tidjane Thiam has been disqualified from running in the Ivory Coast's presidential election in OctoberIn the BBC interview, Thiam suggested that the ruling had been politically motivated.""It's not for the regime to choose who runs opposition parties. It's not for the regime to eliminate opposition leaders,"" he said.""I don't think anybody in the Ivory Coast believes that this is not a weaponisation of the legal system by the government.""This was rejected by Ivory Coast's Information Minister Amadou Coulibaly.""The court rules that at the time he was registered on that [electoral] list, he was not Ivorian,"" he told the BBC's Newsday programme on Friday.""This is clear proof that this gentleman does not know Ivory Coast... We have a problem with morality with Mr Thiam - he knew he was wrong,"" he added.Thiam told the BBC: ""What's happened is that they dug out a 1961 law that has never been applied to anybody. But in theory, it says that if you take another nationality, you lose your Ivorian citizenship.""""Most of the Ivorian football team is in the same case,"" he said, in reference to the national football team which triumphed at the most recent Africa Cup of Nations tournament.""So if we apply the law the way [that] they just applied it to me, we have to give the cup back to Nigeria - because half of the team was not Ivorian.""Although Thiam relinquished his French nationality in March to run in the election, the court found that his candidacy was invalid, given that he was not Ivorian when he first registered on the electoral roll.The 1961 nationality code states that: ""An Ivorian national of full age who voluntarily acquires or states that he possesses a foreign nationality shall lose Ivorian nationality.""Thiam is now mounting a legal challenge.His disqualification came just a week after the centre-right Ivory Coast Democratic Party (PDCI) confirmed him as its presidential candidate.Outraged members of the party say they are suspending all parliamentary activity in protest at his disqualification.His supporters are still hopeful he could be  news from the African continent. on Twitter @BBCAfrica, on Facebook at BBC Africa or on Instagram at bbcafricaIvory Coast",3143,True,0

Legal action against rapper Vedan evokes mixed response - The New Indian Express,https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/2025/May/01/legal-action-against-rapper-vedan-evokes-mixed-response-3,2025-05-01,"KOCHI: Rapper Vedan’s apprehension in a ganja case and his subsequent arrest under the Wildlife Protection Act for the possession of a leopard tooth have sparked a debate, eliciting both support and criticism. Some netizens have alleged that the police and forest department actions are politically motivated and aimed at targeting the artist. Writer, critic, and orator Sunil P Elayidom called the action against Vedan “excessive and inappropriate”, urging a reconsideration on the part of the authorities. “We are surrounded by people openly possessing tiger claw pendants and elephant tusks, yet no action is taken against them. In light of that, slapping a non-bailable offence on Vedan immediately after being granted bail in a minor drug case seems disproportionate,” Elayidom wrote on his social media account. Echoing Elayidom’s views, several voices in cyberspace described the legal actions as a backlash against Vedan’s political identity. Some even compared the treatment of Vedan to that of notorious forest brigand Veerappan, arguing that Vedan’s ‘Dalit-Black’ politics turned him into a target.Musician Ishaan Dev too expressed solidarity with Vedan. “His verses and their spirit are our intoxication. So come back after correction, and we’ll be waiting,” he said. .Minister Saseendran says rapper Vedan’s arrest unfortunate, pulls up forest officials.At the same time, others stressed the importance of upholding the law regardless of artistic credentials. Former MP and lawyer Sebastian Paul said, “Being an artist does not entitle anyone to immunity from the law. If he’s involved in illegal activities, he must face the consequences.” Meanwhile, a senior forest official, speaking on condition of anonymity, defended the department’s actions. “The charges were imposed based on evidence, not personal bias. If Vedan can prove he was unaware the pendant was made of leopard tooth, the charge of hunting will be dropped,” the official said.Supporting that view, Ernakulam Assistant Excise Commissioner M F Suresh said: “If there’s an illegal move, it’s our duty to act. I believe no officer will knowingly impose false charges. We too admire these artists, but we can’t ignore illegalities.” And if they failed to act, the same critics would have accused them of showing favouritism because of celebrity status, the officer added..Vedan granted bail in Leopard tooth possession caseKochi: Vedan was granted bail on Wednesday by the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court in Perumbavoor in connection with the leopard tooth case. The court granted bail after the accused assured his full cooperation with the probe. During the hearing, Hirandas’ counsel submitted that the singer had fully cooperated with the probe and claimed he was unaware that the leopard tooth was authentic, as it was gifted to him by a fan in Chennai. The forest department informed the court that a preliminary inquiry had been completed and the authenticity of the leopard tooth could be confirmed only after a laboratory examination. After hearing both sides, the court granted bail on condition that Hirandas execute a bond of Rs 50,000 with two solvent sureties. The court also directed him to surrender his passport within seven days and to appear before the investigating officer every Thursday. .Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp Download the TNIE app to stay with us and",3384,True,0

Banner: flowcomm/Flickr Reported by Zdravko Ljubas OCCRP Trafficking of pangolin scales and ivory from Africa to Asia has dropped sharply and consistently since 2020, according to a Wildlife Justice Commission (WJC) report released Wednesday, signaling a major shift in global smuggling networks.The report, “Disruption and Disarray: An analysis of pangolin scale and ivory trafficking, 2015–2024,” links the decline to the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on global transport and sustained law enforcement pressure, including arrests of high-level traffickers and disrupted supply chains in Africa.“This significant reduction in the trafficking of pangolin scales and ivory is a testament to the critical impact of focused and collaborative law enforcement efforts,” said Olivia Swaak-Goldman, Executive Director of the WJC. She credited international cooperation and strategic arrests with dismantling criminal operations “at an industrial scale.”She noted the WJC’s partnership with the Nigeria Customs Service as a case study in how pressure at key trafficking hubs can reverberate globally. Continued targeting of crime bosses and financiers, she said, is key to long-term disruption of wildlife crime.According to the report, multi-ton seizures of pangolin scales and ivory have become rare since 2020, with major interceptions now occurring within Africa before goods reach ports. No significant pangolin scale shipments have been seized at seaports in the past three years—an indicator of broken supply chains. However, stockpiles continue to be found in Nigeria, pointing to ongoing criminal investment and the risk of displacement rather than elimination.The WJC warns that a decrease in reported seizures may reflect better enforcement, but it could also signal that traffickers have become",2005,True,0

It’s become a propaganda war, where both sides and their allies are seeking supporters, not just in the seats of government in international organizations, but also in debates in the media and online. Most of those discussions are happening in democracies, where these arguments can still legally take place. We look at where the world’s free countries and un-free ones stand on this conflict.

"First ganja, then tiger tooth: More trouble for Rapper Vedan - The Week",https://www.theweek.in/news/entertainment/2025/04/29/first-ganja-then-tiger-tooth-more-trouble-for-rapper-vedan.html,2025-04-29,"Rapper Vedan (Hirandas Murali) says he still doesn’t know whether the leopard tooth he wears as a locket is real. Vedan was arrested yesterday by the police for cannabis consumption. The leopard tooth was discovered during a police raid on the artist’s flat. Though he was granted bail in the cannabis case, the locket became a new lock for him. The Kodanad range officer of the Forest Department later arrested him and charged him under various sections, including hunting and illicit possession of wildlife articles. The charges are serious, as leopard parts are protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act. Such offences are cognizable and non-bailable. According to the Forest Department, the locket was gifted to Vedan by a fan named Ranjith Kumbidi, who is reportedly of Sri Lankan Tamil origin. The department noted that Vedan’s mother is also a Sri Lankan Tamil—interestingly, the department sees this ethnic link as important in this case. Possession of a leopard tooth is illegal in India—even if done unknowingly—under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The Act strictly prohibits the possession, trade, or display of any part of a leopard, including its teeth, as the species is protected under Schedule I. Conviction on hunting charges can result in imprisonment ranging from three to seven years. However, the governments have, on different occasions, offered voluntary disclosure and amnesty schemes allowing individuals to surrender illegally owned wildlife articles without facing penal action. For instance, in early 2024, the Karnataka government granted a three-month amnesty period for individuals to surrender artefacts made from the body parts of wild animals. Earlier, similar windows were provided in 1973 (30 days) and in 2003 (180 days), under Rule 34(1) of the Wildlife (Conservation) (Karnataka Rules) 1973, for individuals to obtain ownership certificates for wildlife articles. The 2024 amnesty aimed to assist those who had missed out on obtaining such certificates, especially in light of rising complaints against actors and politicians for alleged possession of tiger claws. In Kerala, actor Mohanlal has faced legal trouble since 2011, when elephant tusks and several ivory artefacts were discovered during an income tax raid. Notably, in 2020, the state government issued a no-objection certificate for withdrawing the case against him. However, this was challenged in court, leaving the matter unresolved. In September 2023, the Kerala High Court stayed the trial against Mohanlal in the case. Notably, as Vedan now faces stringent charges, Kerala’s hyperactive social media is debating whether the government is treating him differently because he comes from a marginalized background. In Vedan’s case, authorities are now investigating the origin of the leopard tooth and whether others were involved in its procurement or gifting. The Forest Department has extended its probe beyond Kerala and is also examining a jewellery shop in Thrissur where the tooth was reportedly modified into a pendant. Meanwhile, Vedan’s rap performance has been dropped from the state government’s fourth-anniversary celebrations as he was arrested in the cannabis case.

Previously, the oldest evidence of ivory modification dates back about 120,000 years ago. But the new findings possibly push ivory usage for tools as far back as 400,000 years ago. At a site in Ukraine’s Southern Bug Valley near the town of Medzhybizh, researchers unearthed 24 ivory fragments, along with artifacts made of flint and quartz. They also excavated the remains of horses, large wild cats, and woolly rhinoceroses. The research team suspects that the site was once occupied by a human ancestor called Homo heidelbergensis based on its age and location. However, they have not yet found any evidence to confirm this idea. The site was discovered in 2011 and has been investigated periodically up until 2018. The researchers brought the ivory pieces back to their lab to examine them under a microscope and conduct a 3D analysis. “The study of the ivory began without a specific hypothesis, but their unusual characteristics, indicative of intentional modification, prompted closer examination,” said Vadim Stepanchuk, the lead author of the study and a researcher at the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. The analysis indicated that 14 of the ivory fragments were created by humans. The artifacts show signs of intentional modifications, such as cut marks and various shaping techniques, including one that may have involved placing the ivory on a rock anvil and chipping away flakes using another rock.

This year’s theme, ‘Our Power, Our Planet’, saw campaigners calling on “everyone to unite around renewable energy” to help triple clean electricity by 2030. As the world marked the day, many eco environmental establishments spent time in retrospect, looking at ways of reducing environmental degradation impacts. Highlighting the importance of conserving the local eco-system, Zaina Lodge, the only luxury safari lodge in West Africa situated in Ghana’s Savannah Region, within the Mole National Park shared experiences with some students of the Mole Community School.

Approximately 100 African elephants are killed daily worldwide, a number that is far too high and is caused by poaching, habitat loss and the demand for ivory tusks.

Summer paddy stays intact as Bago Yoma elephants stay away,https://www.gnlm.com.mm/summer-paddy-stays-intact-as-bago-yoma-elephants-stay-away/,2025-04-25,"Subscribe A group of elephants with impressive tusks. Photo: Kanu The elephants from Bago mountain range reside in the summer fields in Taikkyi and Hlegu Townships, Yangon Region, every year, causing human-elephant conflicts. This year, the elephants did not come, and the farmers peacefully and safely harvested their paddy, according to the Forest Department of Hlegu. During the hot season, the springs near the Bago mountain range dry out, and the elephants drink the water and eat the paddy in the villages and forests near the Bago Yoma. When the farmers come to their fields in the daytime, they encounter the elephants. Therefore, the department drove them out and conducted educational programmes to prevent human-elephant conflicts. “Currently, the Bago Yoma elephants eat the paddy in the fields, and we have to drive them out. This year, they did not come because it rained during the Thingyan period, and the lakes were filled with water. Therefore, they did not come here because they had enough water to drink. They usually come here when the paddy is ripe. They entered into three or four villages last year. In March, they come down from the mountain and eat the paddy and sugarcane during the Thingyan period. They return when they hear the sound of a rainstorm. This year, April is almost over, and they have not come here. The farmers get relief. The department conducts educational programmes in every season to prevent human-elephant conflicts, and the conflicts decline,” said U Win Naing, head of the department. Last year, about 10 to 15 elephants entered Layeainsu, Yaynetgyi and Taunghtet villages in Hlegu Township and Phalon, Sanywa, Meelaunggon, Pado, Payhnaselywa, Kuntheehmyaung, Alehmyaung, Maukhon and chaungsauk villages in Taikkyi Township. The elephants from Bago Yoma reside near the forests and caves near the paddy fields, and they return later on 17 May or in early June. Elephants are considered a completely protected species in Myanmar, and hunting is also banned. The Forest Department and NGO jointly install electric fences and conduct awareness campaigns to reduce human-elephant conflicts. — Thitsa (MNA)/KTZH Share this post",2174,True,0

Pay is Negotiable ‌‌ ‌‌ ‌‌ ‌‌ Kenya Battles Rising Wildlife Trafficking of Smaller, Endangered Species Kenya, a nation renowned for its dedication to wildlife preservation, confronts an escalating challenge as the illegal trade in animal and plant products undergoes a significant transformation. Recent judicial proceedings and law enforcement actions reveal a concerning trend: traffickers are diversifying their targets, focusing on smaller, less conspicuous species, thereby complicating detection efforts for authorities. The recent apprehension of two Belgian nationals, a Vietnamese citizen, and a Kenyan national, accused of attempting to smuggle 5,000 live garden ants, underscores this paradigm shift. The insects were meticulously packaged in modified test tubes, designed to sustain them for extended periods, highlighting the ingenuity and resources employed by these smugglers. This incident exemplifies the evolving nature of the international black market for wildlife trophies, where traffickers increasingly target species that, while not traditionally associated with smuggling, command significant value in Asian and European markets. Historically, Kenya's struggle against the illegal wildlife trade has primarily focused on the poaching of elephants and rhinoceroses, driven by the exorbitant prices commanded by their tusks and horns. However, the discovery of garden ants, pangolin scales, and dried butterflies among seized contraband indicates a growing demand for smaller, often critically endangered, wildlife.Pangolins, recognised as the world's most trafficked mammals, epitomise this shift. A notable case in 2017 involved the arrest of Bavon Mukoko Lilungu and Wambua Mbithi at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA), found in possession of 100 kilograms of pangolin scales concealed beneath giraffe and elephant carvings. Despite the presence of seemingly genuine customs stamps from the Kenya Revenue Authority, subsequent investigations revealed these stamps to be counterfeit.Lilungu and Mbithi were each fined Sh1.14 million, with the alternative of a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence. Their case underscored the immense value of pangolin scales on the black market, where a single kilogram could fetch as much as Sh60,000 at the time. A later seizure in 2018 revealed an even",2360,True,0

According to reports, elephants have a unique dental system where their teeth, including the tusks, are continuously replaced throughout their lives. They have six sets of molars, which are replaced as they wear down from grinding food. The teeth, including the tusks, are used for various purposes, such as chewing, digging, and even fighting.

Yes, because first of all the elephant has to be killed in order to extract its precious bony protuberances, and the operation isn't very quick. Then the loot has to be hidden, transported and finally loaded onto a ship bound for Asia, which, despite China's historic ban in 2018, is still the only market that openly deals with ivory, not so much to make jewellery and objets d'art that would be difficult to trade, but for traditional medicine, presuming who knows what beneficial properties that cannot be sought elsewhere, rather than in the murder of protected species. But this is not the only illegal destination for African elephant tusks: the IFAW (International Fund for Animal Welfare) has recently analysed the illegal ivory market in some European countries, including Italy (as well as Germany, France, Holland, Belgium and Portugal), finding s and online markets, not only on the dark web, offering ivory items of which only 10% had the necessary legality certification for that small part of objects that are still marketable. And it is clearly a question of human stupidity, rather than a matter of investment or flaunting values.

Officials Worried As Cruel Illegal Hunting Method Is On The Rise In This National Park,https://www.thetravel.com/illegal-snaring-on-the-rise-in-kruger-national-park/,2025-04-06,"South Africa is home to some of the world's most endangered animals, but it has a rampant and growing poaching problem that has devastated local wildlife communities. Still, the country's efforts in combating poaching take a multi-angle approach. It strengthened law enforcement, supported local communities, utilized cutting-edge tracking technology, and reduced the demand for poached goods, focusing on protecting rhinos and elephants. However, with increased efforts to stop poaching, new, innovative, and very shameful practices are being discovered to combat the growing resistance to their actions. Poachers have invested considerable effort in seeking new methods to capture these animals, safeguard their vital parts for trade purposes, and evade detection. Until recently, criminals had been increasing the number of animals killed in their poaching methods, confusing local law enforcement until their new (old) method was discovered. This particular method of illegal hunting in one of South Africa's most important national parks is sadly on the rise, and officials are concerned. Snaring Of Wild Animals Is On The Rise In Kruger National Park A snare is a trap often consisting of a noose for catching small animals or birds Snares are an illegal method of trapping animals by single metal wire strands that catch the animal's paw, leg, or even neck. As the species is trapped, they die from starvation, dehydration, or by poachers, who arrive to kill the defenseless animal. Speaking to the media on Wednesday, February 19th, 2025, SANParks spokesperson Ike Phaahla says there have recently been two incidents where animals were killed by snares in Kruger National Park (KNP). “Snare poaching is mainly occurring across boundaries, and the sad thing is that it's indiscriminate. Anything that walks into a snare, whether a leopard, a lion, or an elephant, ation of Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) helps mitigate risk, and the installation of cameras, gate cameras, and radar detection systems remotely tracks illegal entry into protected areas. The continued implementation of the KNP Ranger Services Integrity Management Plan assesses the drivers and dynamics of corruption and addresses them with a comprehensive set of actions. The government focuses on extensive reach in whom they hire within the agencies, establishing a cohort of young wildlife professionals to shadow SAoSA members—a second set of eyes on everything that happens. Sometimes, The Best Defense Is A Good Offense To protect wildlife and reduce snaring, officials have taken steps to protect individual animals An ongoing dehorning program, focusing on dehorning all rhinos in core areas, is also a key strategy to deter poachers. Injecting radioactive material into rhino horns to make it easier to track and intercept illegal trade at border posts is being considered. Ultimately, snaring is an extremely harmful trapping method that every country should strive to eliminate. With enough hard work, officials can hopefully bring an end to all the evil poaching practices in Kruger National Park and the rest of the world. Given that conservation efforts have proven to work and even brought some endangered species back from the brink of extinction, it goes to show that consistency and enforcement are key in the fight to save our planet's precious wildlife.",3357,True,0

On March 1, 2025, forest officials discovered a mutilated and charred elephant carcass in the Neruppur Forest Range under Eriyur Police Station limits in Pennagaram Taluk, Dharmapuri district. Authorities suspected the elephant was killed for its tusks, prompting the Forest Department to register a case under relevant wildlife protection laws. During the investigation, G Senthil (28), from Kongarapatti village, was apprehended by forest officials on March 17. However, he reportedly escaped into the forest while handcuffed. Four other accused were arrested on March 19 in the poaching case and remanded in judicial custody. A separate case was filed against Senthil on March 19 for allegedly assaulting officials and fleeing custody. Meanwhile, on April 3, the Forest Department received information about a decomposed male body in the Sarakkadu forest area of Kongarapatti Village. Based on a complaint by the Village Administrative Officer (VAO) of Sunjalnatham, a suspicious death case was registered on April 4. Relatives later identified the deceased as Senthil and raised allegations of foul play, questioning the circumstances leading to his death. Given the seriousness of the allegations—linking illegal wildlife trade to a potential custodial death—the Office of the Director General of Police ordered both cases to be transferred to the CB-CID. “The decision ensures an impartial probe into all angles, including the poaching network and the events surrounding Senthil’s demise,” a police officer said. Madras HC seeks autopsy report of poaching case suspect The Madras High Court directed the State to file the post-mortem report of the suspect who died suspiciously in connection with the recent elephant poaching at Dharmapuri forest range and directed to preserve his mortal remains. Justice GK Ilanthiraiyan heard the petition moved by petitioner Chitra of Kongarapatti alleging that her husband, G Senthil of Kongarapatti, was found dead suspiciously after he was taken by the forest officials for the investigation in the elephant poaching case. The petitioner contended that her husband died suspiciously while in the custody of the forest officials. Further, several wounds and bruises were found all over his body, she said. Hence, she raised serious allegations that her husband was subjected to physical torture by the officials and died. She sought a transparent investigation into her husband's death by an independent agency. The government advocate submitted that the case has been transferred to CB-CID, and a post-mortem examination was done as per the orders of the judicial magistrate at Dharmapuri government hospital. After the submission, the judge directed the State to file the post mortem report and posted the matter to Tuesday; until then, the mortal remains should be kept in preservation, ordered the judge.Also Read:PMK seeks CBI probe into youth's death in Dharmapuri forestPennagaram Magistrate inspects scene of crime The Pennagaram Judicial Magistrate J Nagalakshmi alias Vijayarani on Monday examined the spot where the charred body of suspected poacher G Senthil (28) of Kongarapatti village was found after he allegedly escaped from the custody of forest department officials.",3530,True,0

Excerpts: As you have left, another VC has been appointed; what are your expectations, particularly as it concerns the legacy you left behind in that university? My message to my successor is that he should be a leader that listens to the people. Ultimately, leadership is not about an individual, it’s about a frontal position when you are working with the people. No leader accomplishes things on his own. Leaders should accomplish things through the people and so the first thing I would say to my successor is to connect with them (the workers), work with them, be a part of a team in a sense, not somebody that is distant and somebody that is separate from the people.

They are known for their long tails—sometimes reaching the ground—relatively large ears, and straighter tusks.Fewer than 1,500 are believed to remain in the wild.Despite being smaller than African elephants, the Borneo pygmy is still the largest land mammal on the island, standing at 8.2 to 9.8 feet tall.Once thought to be descendants of a domesticated herd gifted to the Sultan of Sulu in the 17th century, genetic studies have revealed a different story.DNA analysis by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) found that Borneo elephants are genetically distinct from other Asian elephants, having been isolated from their mainland and Sumatran relatives for around 300,000 years.The state government vowed to hold those responsible for the baby elephant's brutal killing in January accountable.State Tourism, Culture and Environment Minister Datuk Seri Christina Liew condemned the act and said her ministry had taken immediate steps to track down the culprits.It is understood Christina will issue a statement after receiving the full investigation report on this latest incident.",1977,True,0

PS Nominee Ouma Oluga: How I Plan To End Medics' Strikes - KahawaTungu,https://kahawatungu.com/ps-nominee-ouma-oluga-how-i-plan-to-end-medics-strikes/?amp=1,2025-04-05,"Principal Secretary nominee for Medical Services, Dr. Ouma Oluga, has pledged to prioritize dialogue over confrontation in handling strikes by health workers, should he be approved for the post. Appearing before the National Assembly’s Health Committee for vetting, Dr. Oluga, who previously served as the Secretary General of the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU), defended his track record as a unionist and outlined how he would approach industrial disputes as a senior government official. The vetting, chaired by Seme MP Dr. James Nyikal, saw several lawmakers raise questions about Oluga’s union background and his ability to transition from activist to policymaker. The nominee led KMPDU from 2014 until 2020, before taking up senior positions at the Nairobi Metropolitan Services and later at the Ministry of Health. Committee members, including Endebess MP Robert Pukose, Kitutu Chache South MP Anthony Kibagendi, and Mogotio MP Reuben Kiborek, pressed Dr. Oluga on how he plans to manage healthcare workers’ strikes if confirmed as PS. “In my past role, I only led one national strike. I bring with me strong organizational and negotiation skills which, I believe, will help resolve issues through dialogue,” said Dr. Oluga. He added that if appointed, he would work closely with trade unions and be transparent about government processes and financial constraints. “I won’t shy away from dialogue. I believe in joint problem-solving and will always be open with union leaders. However, negotiations must be based on truth and guided by the available resources,” he told the committee. On the ongoing concerns surrounding the rollout of the new Social Health Authority (SHA), Dr. Oluga expressed confidence in the system and called for patience. He noted that the previous National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) had taken 59 years to build a membership base of just 6 million, while the new SHA and Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF) had already registered 21 million members in just six months. He said the shift from NHIF to SHA is a step towards achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC), one of the government’s key development goals. “We are implementing a system that is still very new. SHA is just six months old. We must avoid comparing it to a 59-year-old system. Our focus should be on building stability and learning from early challenges,” he said. Dr. Oluga emphasized the need for inclusive policymaking and stronger communication with the public to build trust in the new health insurance model. “One of my guiding principles is listening. We need to examine every concern raised and involve all stakeholders to ensure success,” he said.",2696,True,0

Tourism Association Says Cruise Passenger Attack is Overblown - NewsBreak,https://www.newsbreak.com/cruise-hive-315740882/3948064837182-tourism-association-says-cruise-passenger-attack-is-overblown,,"Following the shocking news that a group of gangs attacked cruise passengers during a cruise call in Mombasa, Kenya, officials have issued an angry press statement. On April 3, 2025, the Kenya Coast Tourism Association (KCTA), Kenya Association of Hotel Keepers and Caterers (KAHC), and the Kenya Association of Tour Operators (KATO) held a joint press conference. Together, they denounced widely circulated coverage, saying it was “sensationalized” by media. While news reports said 50 youths in gangs had attacked and robbed cruise passengers who had been sailing with Crystal Cruises’ Crystal Symphony , the officials said the information was overblown. Instead of numerous thefts from a large group of gangs, the group said it was two “street boys” who stole one passenger’s cell phone. Victor Shitakha, chairman of KCTA, said the news reports damage Kenya’s reputation and can have negative effects on the nation’s tourism. He noted that tourism contributes to 10 percent of Kenya’s gross domestic product. Read Also: How to Stay Safe and Enjoy Your Cruise Vacation Mombasa County Commissioner Mohamed Noor said arrests have been made and that police are in the process of finding other suspects. “Security measures are being strengthened across the Kenyan coast to ensure the safety of both visitors and residents,” he said . He also reassured future cruise passengers that Mombasa is safe to visit. “Let me reassure all our visitors to all our tourism attractions along the Kenyan coast of their safety,” he added . The Aftermath The incident, which sparked outrage from both media and Kenyan authorities, occurred at Mombasa’s Pembe za Ndovu, which means “elephant tusks” in Swahili. The popular monument found on Moi Avenue features four elephant tusks arranged in the letter “M” and commemorates the British royal family’s past visits. While The Standard reported there were 50 young adults and kids who were stealing from the 51,044-gross-ton vessel’s passengers, police said there were no injuries. Local police also increased their presence in the port city. Crystal Cruises also released a statement: “ During Crystal Symphony’s call in Mombasa earlier this week, there was an incident in which one of our guest entertainers was robbed of his cell phone by a small group of local youths. We worked with local authorities and can confirm we did not cancel our stay in Mombasa as previously reported. “ Representatives from the Kenya Tourism Board, the National Police Service, and Crystal Cruises all issued a formal apology to the passengers who were onboard the 1,169-guest vessel. The ship was visiting during a call on its 25-night “Africa & Indian Ocean” voyage from Mumbai, India, to Cape Town, South Africa. The ship, which departed on March 18, 2025, was visiting Mombasa after earlier stops in Goa, India; Colombo, Sri Lanka; and the Maldives and the Seychelles.

Prehistoric animal tusk found in Athens County,https://athensindependent.com/animal-tusk-federal-creek/,2025-04-02,"AMESVILLE, Ohio — Over the past 45 years, Mark Cohen has repeatedly walked along the same creek on his property, a tributary of Federal Creek, finding arrowheads and at least 10 pieces of petrified wood. “I have paid attention to just about everything I can, and so it’s just constantly training my senses to be tuned into things that are interesting and different,” Cohen said. But in early March, he found something truly unusual: the tusk of a prehistoric animal submerged beneath the water. “When I first saw the tusk, I thought it was a piece of petrified wood,” Cohen said. Cohen said when he removed the tusk from the water he “could tell it was a bit brittle.” “It kind of broke when I lifted it,” Cohen said. “I put it together on a table at my house, and I wrapped it up, but within about seven days, it completely disintegrated.” He documented the find with photographs, which he sent to experts from multiple universities, including Ohio University, University of Cincinnati and University of Michigan. Photos of the tusk before degradation. Provided by Mark Cohen. Daniel Fisher, the Claude W. Hibbard Collegiate Professor Emeritus of Paleontology at the University of Michigan, believes the tusk came from a mastodon. In an email to Cohen, Fisher explained that he printed the photo and used a marker to “make a local radius, from the tusk axis outward toward its periphery.” “They’re actually ever-long, ever-growing incisor teeth,” Fisher told the Independent in an interview. “And we know enough about the shapes of these structures that we observed little cues that a casual observer might not pick up on.” Brad Lepper, curator of archaeology at The Ohio History Connection, concurred with Fisher’s analysis. Although best known for his work on Ohio’s prehistoric moundbuilders, Lepper led the 1989 excavation of the Burning Tree Mastodon in Licking County, uncovering the most complete American mastodon skeleton ever found. Based on Cohen’s photos, which the Independent  at the Ohio History Connection, reckoned that the specimen was a mastodon’s tusk “because they’re",2089,True,0

Cocoa Prices Close Sharply Higher as Ivory Coast Cocoa Exports SlowRich Asplund - Barchart - Tue Apr 1,  CDTMay ICE NY cocoa (CCK25) Tuesday closed up +275 (+3.48%), and May ICE London cocoa #7 (CAK25) closed up +103 (+1.66%).Cocoa prices rallied Tuesday after news that Ivory Coast cocoa exports slowed. Tuesday's government data showed that Ivory Coast farmers shipped 1.44 MMT of cocoa to ports this marketing year from October 1 to March 30, up +11% from last year but down from the much larger 35% rise seen in December.Concern about the Ivory Coast's upcoming mid-crop is supporting cocoa prices. The mid-crop is the smaller of two annual cocoa harvests, which typically starts this month. The average estimate for this year's Ivory Coast mid-crop is 400,000 MT, down -9% from last year's 440,000 MT.Cocoa prices have been on the defensive over the past seven weeks and fell to 4-1/2 month lows on March 21 on an improving supply outlook. On February 28, the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) forecasted a global cocoa surplus of 142,000 MT for 2024/25, the first surplus in 4 years. ICCO also projected that 2024/25 global cocoa production will rise +7.8% y/y to 4.84 MMT.The recovery in cocoa inventories is also bearish for prices. Since falling to a 21-year low of 1,263,493 bags on January 24, ICE-monitored cocoa inventories held in US ports have rebounded and climbed to a 5-1/4 month high Tuesday of 1,855,268 bags.

None believes the shortfall can be made up from other funding sources.“These funding cuts could not have come at a worse time.

(AP Photo/Misper Apawu) By Monika Pronczuk and Misper Apawu Reporter Monika Pronczuk and photographer Misper Apawu were the first to document the real-world consequences of frozen U.S. aid that had long supported Ivory Coast’s fight against insecurity in the increasingly volatile West Africa region. Their reporting focused on the remote village of Kimbirila-Nord, a community that has been marginalized and isolated by the central government for years. After jihadist groups struck a nearby Malian town, USAID had launched an aid program aimed at preventing extremist groups from taking hold in the dense forest that straddles the Ivory Coast-Mali border. Now, with U.S. foreign aid slashed, that support is gone—even as violence in Mali and across the Sahel has reached record levels, pushing tens of thousands of refugees into Ivory Coast. To report the story, Pronczuk and Apawu traveled to one of the most remote regions of Ivory Coast, a 15-hour drive from the capital, Abidjan. Due to a series of jihadist attacks five years ago, the area was designated a special military operations zone, requiring the journalists to navigate significant bureaucratic and security hurdles. They met with officials in Abidjan and in every town and village they passed through before reaching Kimbirila-Nord—a village with no running water and limited phone or internet access that few journalists have ever reached. Their reporting shines a light on how geopolitical decisions made in Washington are being felt in some of the world’s most vulnerable and underreported places.

Additionally, advancements in cloning and genetic engineering could support elephant conservation.

Cocoa Prices Soar as Ivory Coast Cocoa Exports SlowRich Asplund - Barchart - Mon Mar 24,  CDTMay ICE NY cocoa (CCK25) Monday closed up +314 (+4.04%), and May ICE London cocoa #7 (CAK25) closed up +243 (+4.00%).Cocoa prices on Monday finished sharply higher as concerns about slowing Ivory Coast cocoa exports sparked short covering in cocoa futures. Monday's government data showed that Ivory Coast farmers shipped 1.43 MMT of cocoa to ports this marketing year from October 1 to March 23, up +12% from last year. However, the pace has fallen from the 35% rise seen in December.Cocoa prices have been on the defensive over the past five weeks and fell to 4-1/4 month lows last Friday on an improving supply outlook. On February 28, the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) forecasted a global cocoa surplus of 142,000 MT for 2024/25, the first surplus in 4 years. ICCO also projected that 2024/25 global cocoa production will rise +7.8% y/y to 4.84 MMT.The recovery in cocoa inventories is also bearish for prices. Since falling to a 21-year low of 1,263,493 bags on January 24, ICE-monitored cocoa inventories held in US ports have rebounded and climbed to a 4-1/2 month high of 1,784,552 bags last Friday. Also on the bearish side, Nigeria reported on February 27 that its Jan cocoa exports jumped +27% y/y to 46,970 MT. Nigeria is the world's fifth-largest cocoa producer.Concern about the Ivory Coast's upcoming mid-crop is limiting the downside in cocoa prices. The mid-crop is the smaller of two annual cocoa harvests, which typically start in April. The average estimate for this year's Ivory Coast mid-crop is 400,000 MT, -9% below last year's 440,000 MT.Demand concerns are also weighing on cocoa prices. Executives from chocolate makers Hershey and Mondelez recently warned that high prices are hurting demand. On February 4, Mondelez executives warned of a potential slowdown in chocolate demand when CFO Zarmella said, ""We are seeing signs, particularly in parts of the world",2186,True,0

The tourism model is seen as an humane approach that should be maintained to protect the elephant population.Two years ago, the Buon Don Suspension Bridge Tourism Centre halted its elephant riding service, replacing it with friendly and close interactions between tourists and the animals, which have stood as a powerful symbol in the Central Highlands’ culture, history and natural landscape. Visitors can now feed the elephants, take photos with them, bathe them, and observe health blessing ceremonies as well as elephant buffets.The centre has paid due attention to providing a better living environment for elephants, including proper diet, medical care, and suitable accommodations.It has worked to raise tourist awareness of animal protection and renew the model by connecting it with other tourism products and developing community-based tourism to attract visitors.Trần Thị Kim Anh, Director of the Biệt Điện Tourism and Hotel Branch – the entity managing the Buôn Đôn Suspension Bridge Tourism Centre, said that after two years of implementation, the model has achieved encouraging results, helping improve the living conditions of both elephants and local communities and becoming a highlight of the centre's activities.Elephant-friendly tourism is a responsible form that helps minimise the impact of tourism activities on elephant health, contributing to conservation efforts and sustainable elephant tourism.The implementation of this model is a step to carry out the memorandum of understanding signed between the provincial People’s Committee and Animals Asia in 2021, aiming to end elephant riding tourism and activities affecting the welfare of domesticated elephants in tourism and festivals.Challenges to addressDespite achieving mostly positive results, it still faces many challenges, requiring joint efforts from the local administration, community and enterprises.According to the Đắk Lắk Centre for Elephant Conservation, Animal Rescue and Forest Protection Management, the province is now home to 35 domesticated elephants, mainly in Lắk and Buôn Đôn districts.The domesticated elephant population is aging, mostly over 40 years old, and due to unsuccessful breeding, the herd faces a very high risk of extinction. Grazing areas and food sources for elephants are shrinking, leading to potential conflicts over habitation.Further' workshop organised by the Simexco Daklak Co. Ltd in Buôn Ma Thuột City earlier this month, agencies, businesses, local authorities, elephant handlers and stakeholders discussed and proposed solutions to protect domesticated elephants and develop the elephant-friendly tourism model.Vice Chairman of the People’s Committee of Buôn Đôn District Y Si That Ksor said alongside advocacy for transitioning from elephant riding to elephant-friendly tourism, the province and its localities need to integrate programmes and non-governmental projects to ensure alternative livelihoods for elephant owners and handlers.Support in infrastructure, technical materials, and vocational skills is essential to promote the development of other tourism offerings.Ryan Hockley, Animals Asia Elephant Welfare Advisor, said that with the model, the animals live closer to their natural instincts and have better health as well as longer lifespans.Solutions for developing this model include understanding tourist tastes, improving tour quality, identifying potential customer groups and promoting across multiple platforms.Meanwhile, Director of the Đắk Lắk Department of Culture, Sports and Tourism Nguyễn Thuỳ Phương Hiếu stated that this model is the province's direction in conserving rare and endangered wildlife. The province has directed localities, units, and businesses to gradually replace and completely end elephant riding tourism after 2026.The elephant-friendly tourism model has been linked with many activities and tourism products such as experiencing the Lao culture and traditional cuisine, hiking, camping, cycling for sightseeing, exploring the legendary Serepok River, and enjoying gong performances to create impressions for tourists, she added. — VNS Environment Foreign experts remove tusks to save eight-year-old elephant Having an accident leading to broken tusks, an eight-year-old fostered elephant in the Central Highlands province of Đắk Lắk had both removed by expert veterinarians. Environment The tragedy of Tây Nguyên elephants Driven by a blind belief that elephant fur and tusks would bring good luck to the owner, one action multiplied into ten, and ten multiplied into a hundred, leading to an unexpected calamity for the elephants of the Central Highlands. Environment Asian elephant alliance launched The Asian Elephant Alliance (AEA) calls for partnership and collective action as it acknowledges that the challenges faced by the elephants in our region cannot be solved in isolation.

Columbia University, while not the worst in Schrecker’s account, was certainly not the best. Today, as the New York Times has revealed, it’s probably the worst. At the height of the Second Red Scare, just as the House Un-American Activities Committee was beginning its first of many hearings on the threat of communism in higher education, a group of thirty-seven university presidents from the nation’s most prestigious and elite institutions, including Columbia, gathered to make a statement of principles on academic freedom and the Cold War.

As Pope Francis marks 12 years since his election as the 265th successor of St. Peter, Catholic Bishops in Ivory Coast have expressed gratitude to God for his leadership. In a statement issued Thursday, March 13, members of the Episcopal Conference of Ivory Coast (CECCI) highlight “wisdom and dedication” as virtues that have marked Pope Francis’ pontificate since his election as Pope on 13 March 2013. “The whole Church, united with Pope Francis, gives thanks to God today on the twelfth anniversary of his pontificate,” CECCI members say. They acknowledge his virtues, saying, “For twelve years, the Successor of Peter has guided the Church's boat with wisdom and dedication.” The Catholic Church leaders express their spiritual solidarity with Pope Francis, who has been at Rome’s Gemelli Hospital since February 14, where he is being treated for double pneumonia. “We wish him the best of health and prosperity as he carries out his Petrine ministry,” CECCI members say. Jorge Mario Cardinal Bergoglio was aged 76 when he was elected Pope. He took the name Pope Francis in honour of St. Francis of Assisi. He is the first Latin American Pope and the first from the Society of Jesus (SJ/Jesuits). In another goodwill message, the leadership of the Catholic Diocese of Kokstad in South Africa “joins the world in remembering and celebrating the 12th anniversary of the election of Pope Francis.” “While praying for his speedy recovery, we recall with gratitude the start of his Pontificate,” Bishop Thulani Victor Mbuyisa says in the March 13 statement, and adds, “We pray that the Lord strengthens his faith, gives him",1935,True,0

The Brighton loanee is also in contention for the Mali national side in their 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying games. Les Aigles are yet to name their 2026 World Cup qualifying squad for the March fixtures but many sources in Mali suggested Yalcouyé is expected to be included by head coach Tom Saintfiet for the matches against Comoros and Central African Republic. The 19-year-old has scored four Austrian Bundesliga goals for Sturm Graz and was a top performer for them in the UEFA Champions League. He is a graduate of Ivorian side ASEC Mimosas youth team. Ivory Coast hoped his connection to ASEC would push Yalcouyé towards them. Nevertheless, Yalcouye is not expected to say no to Mali if they call him up for the March qualifiers. Ivory Coast lost out on MC Alger midfielder Mohamed Zougrana to Burkina Faso earlier this month. Yalcouyé could be the second one if he decides to represent his country of birth, Mali. ← Previous Post: 2026 World Cup Qualifying: Libya-based forward Orebonye leads Botswana squad Next Post: CAFCC: Simba SC versus Al Masry in limbo as CAF closes Benjamin Mkapa Stadium → Français (573)North Africa (1871)Southern Africa (2123)Africans Abroad (1720)National Teams (1366)West Africa (2267)Women's Football (356)Domestic Football (2934)East Africa (1584)Central Africa (421)Football Administration (70)CAF (64)FIFA Club World Cup (197)WCQ March (9)CAFCC Preview (1)CAFCL Preview (3)Domestic Competitions (3140)Continental Club Competitions (594)National Team Competitions (1489) Recent Post",1745,True,0

The jump-off speed kept getting faster, with U.S. Olympian Mclain Ward setting a very quick pace of 37.80 seconds early on with First Lady, owned by Robin Parsky. Nassar knew the track suited his horse and executed the winning ride as the last to return. “It had a lot of turns which is generally very good for her,” he said about the jump-off course. “She’s not the biggest-strided horse, so in a straight line I have a hard time leaving strides out, but on the turns she’s so small and agile I can match most other numbers. The one turn by the in-gate got a little out of hand, but Ivory is such a trier. There’s nothing she believes she can’t do so I just dropped my reins and let her take over. Somehow we squeaked over the back rail and it was enough today.” Mclain Ward & First Lady. Photo ©Sportfot As last to go, they crossed the timers in 37.11 seconds, the clear winners.

Videos Show Narwhals Using Their Tusks to Play With Their Food - The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/12/science/narwhals-tusks-video.html,2025-03-12,"“They’re extremely shy and elusive whales,” said Kristin Laidre, an applied animal ecology professor at the University of Washington who was not involved in the study. “They’re really hard to approach. They’re really skittish.” She added that narwhals tended to spend their time far from shore and diving deep into the water, and that doing research in the Arctic was logistically complex, making them a challenging species to observe in the wild.With the help of local Inuit communities, the team of researchers identified a spot in the Canadian High Arctic to set up camp and fly drones. The calm waters of Creswell Bay in Nunavut, where narwhals had previously been observed spending their summers, were shallow and clear and — combined with the 24-hour daylight in August — allowed the researchers to film some of the best footage of narwhals ever captured.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

The decision to leave behind my university career after nearly a decade in administration and considerably longer in teaching emerged not merely from the magnetic pull of a compelling opportunity at the Heritage Foundation, though that institution’s offer proved irresistible. Rather, this transition involved disquiet about the trajectory of American higher education, a concern informed by my unusually panoramic view of the contemporary university landscape.

Baby elephant rescued after it became separated from mother - Newspaper - DAWN.COM,https://www.dawn.com/news/1897374/baby-elephant-rescued-after-it-became-separated-from-mother,2025-03-12,"JAKARTA: Indonesian authorities rescued a critically endangered baby Sumatran elephant after it became separated from its mother at a palm oil plantation, a local official said on Tuesday. Sumatran elephants are on the brink of extinction with only about 2,400-2,800 left in the world, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature. The two-month-old male calf was found at an oil palm plantation in Riau province on the western island of Sumatra on Monday after residents alerted authorities, local conservation agency official Ujang Holisudin said. “We suspect this elephant was left behind by his group or his mother,” Ujang said, adding that the calf was alone when authorities found him. The baby elephant is in good health after medical checks and was brought to the conservation agency’s elephant training centre near the provincial capital Pekanbaru, he said. Authorities were monitoring for elephant herds near the area to see if the calf could be reunited with its family. “It is our hope that the group can be found and we can reunite (the calf). That is our hope,” Ujang said. Elephant populations are threatened by rampant poaching for their tusks, which are prized in the illegal wildlife trade. The Southeast Asian nation is battling wildlife crime and several cases of elephant poisoning have been reported in recent years.

Ivory Coast opposition parties form coalition ahead of presidential poll - Africanews,https://www.africanews.com/2025/03/11/ivory-coast-opposition-parties-form-coalition-ahead-of-presidential-poll/,2025-07-26,"Ivory Coast Dozens of opposition parties in Ivory Coast have formed an alliance ahead of the country’s president poll due to take place in October. The Coalition for a Peaceful Alternation is hoping to push demands for electoral reform and impose a balance of power on the ruling party. Heavyweights include the Democratic Party of Ivory Coast (PDCI), the country's oldest party, the Movement of Capable Generations (MGC) of former first lady, Simone Gbagbo, and Charles Blé Goudé's Young Patriots of Ivory Coast, COJEP. “For its part, our coalition decided today to take another step forward in its project to strengthen the grouping of the opposition by formalising this structure,” said Simone Gbagbo on behalf of the alliance. But one major party is missing from the new coalition, that of former president Laurent Gbagbo. With the opposition in three blocs, there’s a risk of votes being divided among them which could benefit the ruling party. Unless the new coalition manages to rally support beyond its ranks. Political analyst, Christophe Koffi, believes the President Alassane Ouattara’s party will have something to worry about if the vote goes to a second round. “Unlike in Cameroon, the political parties have formed a bloc and the electorate will be very large around this bloc,” he said. “If they manage to force the party in power to a second round, there will be a grouping of all the opposition voters around whoever comes in pole position and I think that this could upset the ruling party.” Koffi said it “should not underestimate this coalition that has been put in place”. With the campaign shaping up to be a tense one, the question remains whether the newly formed alliance will have an impact on the October elections. You may also",1756,True,0
Appeal cuts Zambezi man's 9-year sentence for ivory dealing to 5 years - The Namibian -,https://www.namibian.com.na/appeal-cuts-zambezi-mans-9-year-sentence-for-ivory-dealing-to-5-years/,2025-03-11,"Appeal cuts Zambezi man’s 9-year sentence for ivory dealing to 5 years By Werner Menges 11 March 2025 Two Windhoek High Court judges have reduced an effective prison term of nine years to which a Zambezi region resident was sentenced for dealing in elephant tusks to five years’ imprisonment. Sipangule Kushonya’s sentence was lowered in an appeal judgement delivered by judges Naomi Shivute and Philanda Christiaan yesterday. Kushonya (39) was sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment, of which three years were suspended for a period of five years, in April 2022, after he had been found guilty in the Katima Mulilo Magistrate’s Court on a charge of dealing in two elephant tusks. In the appeal judgement, Kushonya’s sentence has now been changed to seven years’ imprisonment, of which two years are suspended for a period of five years on condition that he is not convicted of dealing in controlled wildlife products, committed during the period of suspension. Kushonya was arrested in November 2019, after he had offered two elephant tusks for sale to an undercover staff member of the Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism at a village in the Kongola area of the Zambezi region. The two tusks weighed about 4,6kg and were valued at about N$2 500. During his trial, Kushonya claimed he knew nothing about the ivory he was accused of offering to sell. He also claimed, though, that the elephant tusks belonged to a Zambian national who had left it in his care. The crime Kushonya was convicted of “is indeed serious and prevalent, not only in the Zambezi region, but countrywide if not worldwide”, Christiaan said in the High Court’s appeal judgement.

Outlined in recently published findings, the technique analyzes isotope ratios of the element strontium (Sr), which accumulates in tooth enamel. For large plant-eating land mammals, the relative abundance of two strontium isotopes in teeth and tusks reflects where the creature may have roamed during its lifetime.

It can also be applied to studies of modern conservation and forensics, to trace the origins of illegal ivory trade and other forms of wildlife trafficking.” The star of the study is Misha, a female elephant acquired by Salt Lake City’s Hogle Zoo in 2005.

That is our hope,” Mr Ujang said.Elephant populations are threatened by rampant poaching for their tusks, which are prized in the illegal wildlife trade.The south-east Asian nation is battling wildlife crime and several cases of elephant poisoning have been reported in recent years.Deforestation has also reduced their natural habitat and brought them into increasing conflict with humans.

The study shows how these “influencers” are shaping and moulding young boys’ opinion, pushing a negative narrative and regressive attitude towards women.Over and colleagues surveyed 100 secondary-school teachers (teaching children aged 11 and older) and 100 primary school teachers (teaching ages 4 to 11) in the UK. The survey aimed to capture teachers’ perceptions of the influence of online misogyny on students. The analysis of the survey data showed that 76 per cent of the secondary and 60 per cent of the primary school teachers reported extreme concern about the influence of online misogyny on their students.When asked about influences on male and female students specifically, the teachers tended to reference instances of male students praising misogynistic ideas and engaging in misogynistic behaviour against female students and staff and instances in which female students were victims of misogyny. The report also mentions how one teacher shared that the they heard a male student say it is “ok to hurt women because Andrew Tate does it,” while another reported that female students were “worried about coming to school due to what the boys may say or do to them.”Ninety per cent of the secondary and 68 per cent of the primary school teachers reported feeling their schools would benefit from teaching materials specifically meant to address the impact of online misogyny.A few years ago, the IIM Ahmedabad too had reported a study where students in higher educational institutions talked about casual sexism being ignored or largely being the accepted norm.

INTEL FROM THE IVORY TOWER: Evidence That Medicaid Does Matter For Americans,https://pagosadailypost.com/2025/03/10/intel-from-the-ivory-tower-evidence-that-medicaid-does-matter-for-americans/,2025-03-10,"Texas Democrat Al Green of Houston got the most attention of his lengthy congressional career by shaking up the State of the Union to call attention to proposed cuts to Medicaid. He was censured by Congress, but now people are talking about this health program. In an earlier article about Medicaid, I compared the health of people in states that expanded it with those that chose not to, focusing on how many state residents report having only fair to poor health, broken down by how women and men responded in surveys. In this article, I report those results that compare across states. In a 2023 ranking, the CDC ranked all of the states. “To determine the healthiest states, we assessed all 50 states in the US based on 12 different criteria and assigned a score out of 100 for each criterion. These individual scores were then combined and weighted to obtain a final score of 100. The data for these key indicators were collected from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).” The CDC measure states “The indicators include… Air Quality, Obesity Percentage, Adults with No Physical Leisure-time Activity, Prevalence of Sleeping Less Than 7 Hours Among Adults, Current Smoking Rates for Adults, Percentage of Binge Drinkers Among Adults, Percent of Adults Who Report Consuming Vegetables Less Than Once Daily, Percent of Adults Who Report Consuming Fruits Less Than Once Daily, Percentage of Adults with High Blood Cholesterol, Prevalence of Cancer Among Adults, Prevalence of Depression Among Adults, and Prevalence of Coronary Heart Disease Among Adults. The average ranking of states that expanded Medicaid was “23,” with a “1” being the best possible score. For the states that chose not to expand Medicaid, their average ranking was “35.5,” much closer the worst possible score of “50”. For those who think it’s important, the difference of means test was statistically significant. It’s not the only analysis I’ve run on Medicaid.

The men were visiting their friend Jordan Willis’ rental home in Kansas City, Mo., to watch the Chiefs play the Los Angeles Chargers on Jan. 7, 2024. Two days later, the trio was found dead in the backyard. Throughout the investigation, police repeatedly said ""no foul play"" had been ""observed or suspected."" Early toxicology reports reportedly indicated the men had cocaine and fentanyl in their systems, WDAF and TMZ, reported in February 2024, citing sources. However, police reiterated that the case remained an ""ongoing death investigation."" Zahnd said this week that while searching the home after the incident, police found two plastic bags containing ""white powdery substances."" After being tested by police, one of the bags came back positive for cocaine. Willis is now one of two people accused of supplying the drugs that led to the trio's death. Willis and Ivory Carson, were each charged with ""distribution of a controlled substance and three counts of involuntary manslaughter,"" Zahnd said. Both are being held on $100,000 cash bond, according to the Associated Press. Each charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. David Harrington, Clayton McGeeney and Ricky Johnson.

Africa's elephants have been in dramatic decline for 50 years. What can be done to save them,https://theconversation.com/africas-elephants-have-been-in-dramatic-decline-for-50-years-what-can-be-done-to-save-them-new-study-250293,2025-04-30,"Getty Images Surveying elephants is hard, risky work. Dedicated biologists have been doing this challenging task across Africa for decades. Systematic surveying started in the late 1960s but has been sporadic, as access to remote areas takes logistical planning, funding and well-trained teams. Surveys can easily be derailed by civil unrest or lack of available survey teams. Consequently, the information on the numbers of elephants across Africa is spotty. Even for a single population, survey effort and coverage can change over the years. Still, the efforts of governments and conservation organisations to count elephants have amassed a remarkable dataset, held by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and its African Elephant Specialist Group. It’s a complex dataset, which has made it harder to see general scale trends in the numbers of elephants, until now. In a new study, my colleagues and I have put together data from 1,325 surveys of elephant populations – everything we could find – to evaluate how elephant numbers in Africa have changed over the last 50 years or so. This research provides the most comprehensive assessment of trends in the two species of elephants in Africa: the forest elephant and the savanna elephant. The results were eye opening. African elephants have experienced serious losses in contemporary times (between 1964 and 2016). The average population trend for African savanna elephants was a decline of 70%. Forest elephant populations declined by over 90%. While declines in the species had been widely recognised, understanding of the overall magnitude and regional context was lacking until now. We found that over the past 50 years there has been a shift in the distribution of elephants across Africa. Population sizes have shifted too. Three-quarters of today’s forest and savanna elephant populations are smaller than 500 individuals. Our team of African elephant conservation and survey data analysis experts have highlighted the areas most at risk of losing their elephant populations. We’ve also provided area-specific insight to elephant conservation successes and failures. The research shows that maintaining current elephant numbers, let alone reversing declines, requires new thinking and conservation innovation. : Nigeria's last elephants -- what must be done to save them Quantifying scales of decline Declining elephant numbers are not surprising, given the level of ivory poaching and the degree of human population growth and associated landscape modification across Africa over the past 60 years. And this killing continues. Hundreds of elephants are illegally killed each year, according to the Monitoring of Illegal Killing of Elephants programme. The scale of the decline merited listing savanna elephant species as endangered and forest elephant species as critically endangered. But this was not without controversy. In places, growing elephant populations are creating management challenges, such as in and around Chobe National Park, Botswana. Thus, the reality at some sites does not match the overall, average trend of populations across the continent. Our analysis was structured to give insight into the diversity of trends. We also did this for the two species separately. We were able to dissect which populations had experienced losses and which had gains, finding that trends varied by population. What we found We found that southern Africa experienced the greatest diversity of trends. Half the sites were stable or increasing over the study period. Populations in Botswana and Zimbabwe, in particular, grew robustly and now hold the majority of savanna elephants in Africa. Increasing populations were rare in other regions. All the populations of savanna elephants in the northern part of sub-Saharan Africa showed declines. Many populations in the northern savannas of Chad, Nigeria, Cameroon and Mali have been lost. Most remaining populations in the region are under serious threat. Only remnant populations remain in the northern savannas, typically isolated from each other. East and central Africa, where most elephants once resided, underwent serious losses over this period due to ivory poaching. : A first for large African mammals: DNA used to count Gabon's endangered forest elephants Can we turn declines around? Reversing the downward trend is difficult. Ivory poaching has driven large scale declines over relatively short periods of time in Africa. Stemming the ivory trade has proven difficult as it requires global recognition and action. Over the longer term, erosion of elephant range finishes off remnant populations. Once elephant populations are lost, an area may lose its protection, accelerating landscape changes. Concerted efforts must be made to slow the erosion of remaining wildlands. Despite the broad scale decline, there are numerous examples of populations that are stable or increasing. Some are even within areas with few persisting elephant populations. These successes suggest ways to reverse elephant declines: tackling habitat loss, landscape conversion and ivory poaching. : Elephants use the tips of their trunks to grasp things with great precision – how this can help robotic design Reversing the elephant population decline Firstly, public-private partnerships in protected area management should be considered. In many countries, there’s not enough management capacity, leading to “paper” parks. These are parks that are legally gazetted but in fact are not functional. Institutional partnerships between relevant government departments and the private sector – non-governmental organisations focused on conservation – can uplift management efforts. This can also drive progress towards economic sustainability of protected areas. We have seen several examples of this with African Parks, a non-governmental organisation that directly manages numerous protected areas across Africa with government support. Secondly, working with neighbouring communities and land use managers to maintain the integrity of the landscape for wildlife",6077,True,0

These companies often cite technical reasons to deny coverage, leaving customers frustrated and financially burdened. Among the most debated offerings is a policy advertised with an appealing tagline:coverage for all pre-existing illnesses after a waiting period of two or three years. While this promise attracts many consumers,the reality of claiming benefits can be far less straightforward. The design of these policies has been called into question as potentially misleading.Companies collect significant premiums with the assurance of future coverage,yet they frequently find ways to reject claims when the time comes. A recent incident involving TATA AIG,a prominent insurance provider, exemplifies this issue.In this case,a policyholder disclosed all existing illnesses when purchasing the policy. Three years later, when the individual was admitted to the hospital, their claim was denied.The reason?. The pre-existing conditions were not entered into the company’s system—a technicality that nullified the coverage. Such denials,critics argue, are not accidental but part of a deliberate strategy.By relying on simple oversights or procedural loopholes,insurance companies can evade their obligations while continuing to profit from premiums. This raises serious concerns about transparency and accountability in the insurance industry.For the affected policyholder,what seemed",1696,True,0

"He Received a Shoutout From His Brothers, but What is Keenen Ivory Wayans' Net Worth?",https://blavity.com/keenen-ivory-wayans-net-worth,,"February 27, 2025 Keenen Ivory Wayans is part of Hollywood royalty, having introduced his famous Wayans Family to the television and film industry. Keenen’s decades-long career has seen him excel in every facet of entertainment from acting to producing and directing. He is also a talented screenwriter, who was the mastermind behind the adored sketch comedy series, In Living Color. This series ran for five seasons from 1990 to 1994, helping to launch the careers of Jim Carrey, Jamie Foxx, Jennifer Lopez, and the Wayans Family as a whole. Keenen’s contributions to the culture were celebrated in February 2025 when he along with his famous loved ones were inducted into the NAACP Image Awards’ Hall of Fame. While Keenen was not present at the ceremony, his relatives, Damon Wayans, Marlon Wayans, Damon Wayans Jr., and Kim Wayans, took the stage and dedicated much of their big moment to their older brother. “We would not be here standing here if it wasn’t for our big brother, Keenen Ivory Wayans,” Marlon stated.

REUTERS/Luc Gnago/File Photo ABIDJAN, Feb 25 (Reuters) – Ivory Coast’s customs have seized around 2,000 metric tons of falsely declared cocoa beans worth around $19 million at its main port in Abidjan, two customs sources and one judicial source said on Tuesday. Cocoa, the main ingredient in chocolate, is usually smuggled over Ivory Coast’s western border to Guinea and Liberia where traffickers pay above the local farmgate price for the commodity. However, last week Ivorian customs discovered that a cocoa exporter had made a false declaration to pay less tax on the shipment at the port. They seized 110 containers that according to the document were supposed to contain rubber, a customs officer familiar with the case told Reuters. “To my knowledge, this is the first time we’ve made such a seizure. 2,000 tons, or around 15 million pounds, is a huge amount,” another officer said. The tax on this shipment should have been 19.5%, including the 14.5% tax on cocoa exports and the 5% registration tax. In that case, the Ivorian state would have collected 2.9 million pounds in taxes. Meanwhile, the tax on rubber exports is only 1.5%. A source close to the judicial authorities said this fraud was possible due to the high level of corruption in the administration and the complicity of various departments. “We seized this case … and we are still investigating. We can’t say anything at the moment,” said a prosecutor close to the case.

The chaos was reportedly triggered by the loud sound of firecrackers set off during the temple's celebrations.The incident occurred on the final day of the festival, as the elephants participated in the evening procession known as 'seeveli.' At approximately 6 PM, one of the elephants became aggressive after being startled by the fireworks, pushing the other elephant with its tusks. This provoked a brief scuffle between the animals, causing panic among the crowd. As people scrambled to escape, many were trampled or injured in a stampede. A temporary festival office also collapsed under the elephants’ movements.The three victims, identified as Leela (65), Ammukutty Amma (70), and Rajan, died during the ensuing stampede. At least 30 others were injured, including a 10-year-old girl. Among the injured, eight people are in critical condition, with many others receiving treatment at Kozhikode Medical College and nearby hospitals.According to Rajeesh, a local municipal councillor, the elephants were agitated by the fireworks, which led to the violent outburst. He explained that while it is unclear whether the victims were killed by the elephants or in the stampede, many were severely hurt in the chaos. Visual footage from the scene showed the elephants charging and pushing each other, which further heightened the panic.Koyilandy MLA Kanathil Jameela commented that most of the injuries were caused by people falling during the commotion and being kicked by the elephants.

These “agreements are at the root of the problem. As long as these agreements exist, France will be able to use them to carry out military maneuvers or intervene at the request of its servants in power in Ivory Coast,” general secretary of the Revolutionary Communist Party of Ivory Coast (PCRCI), Achy Ekissi, told Peoples Dispatch.The only concrete commitment made by Ouattara in his speech was that “the camp of the 43rd BIMA, the Marine Infantry Battalion of Port-Bouët, will be handed over to the Ivorian Armed Forces as of January 2025.”Originally known as the 43rd Infantry Regiment, and established in 1914 as a detachment of the French colonial army in Ivory Coast, this battalion served France “during both world wars, the Indochina War, and the Algerian War. In 1978, it was renamed the 43rd BIMA without altering its primary mission: safeguarding imperialist interests, particularly those of France, monitoring neocolonial regimes, and intervening militarily when necessary to uphold the neocolonial order,” PCRCI said in a statement.Directly under French command, this battalion “is one of the visible faces of French domination in Ivory Coast,” which the former colonial power needs to invisibilize to salvage the last few military footholds it has left in its former colonies in the West African region.France Reorganizing Toward ‘A Less Entrenched, Less Exposed Model’ of Military Deployment“We have bases in Senegal, Chad, Ivory Coast, and Gabon.

China and the chocolate factory: investment in Ivory Coast helps secure a cocoa edge,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-chocolate-factory-investment-ivory-093000963.html,2025-02-11,"In the heart of West Africa, where the world's finest cocoa beans are cultivated, Chinese investment has built new processing factories in Ivory Coast and Ghana. On the outskirts of Abidjan, Ivory Coast's economic capital, China Light Industry Nanning Design Engineering has finished building the nation's largest cocoa plant and a cocoa bean warehouse. It comes from one of the two deals the Chinese company signed with Ivory Coast in 2019 to build processing plants. The other is in the southwestern coastal city of San Pedro. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. The Chinese government advanced US$199.9 million to build the plants, with each intended to have an annual processing capacity of 50,000 tonnes (55,100 tons). The company also agreed to build cocoa warehouses in each location, with storage capacity of 140,000 tonnes and 160,000 tonnes. In return, 40 per cent of the output from the two processing plants would be sold to Chinese companies. Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa bean producer, accounting for about 40 per cent of global cocoa production and exports. The raw cocoa beans - chocolate's main ingredient - is the country's major export product. The chocolate confectionery market generated a revenue of US$133.6 billion in 2024, the German data platform Statista said. According to the International Cocoa Organisation, only 6 per cent of this value reaches cocoa-exporting countries.

Dry Season In Ivory Coast Triggers Cocoa Shortage Fears – Farmers - Checkout Magazine,https://www.checkout.ie/supply-chain/dry-season-in-ivory-coast-triggers-cocoa-shortage-fears-farmers-215915,2025-02-11,"Supply Chain Dry Season In Ivory Coast Triggers Cocoa Shortage Fears – Farmers February 11, 2025 9:30 AM By Reuters  Facebook Icon Twitter Icon Whatsapp Icon  Facebook Icon Twitter Icon Whatsapp Icon A lack of rain in most of Ivory Coast’s cocoa-growing regions could delay the start of the April to September mid-crop, potentially leading to a shortage of beans, farmers said on Monday. The world’s top cocoa producer is in the dry season that runs from mid-November to March when rains are scarce and poor, and farmers say it is very hot compared to last year. Farmers said they can no longer expect beans of good quality at the start of the mid-crop season in April as the soil moisture content was weak and the heat was drying leaves on trees. They warned that if plantations don’t receive two significant rains before the end of February, the mid-crop would start slowly with a possible shortage of the key ingredient for chocolate in April. Farmers Farmers from the country’s central regions said they were concerned about the development of the mid-crop harvest because some trees had started to show signs of weakness due to a prolonged lack of adequate rains.  Stephane M’Bra, who farms near the west-central region of Daloa, said, “When you look at the foliage of some plantations, you think it’s swollen shoot disease (which reduces crop yields before killing trees). “But it’s the heat and lack of rain that cause leaves to fall.” No rain fell in Daloa last week. Similar comments were reported in the central region of Bongouanou, which recorded 0.5mm of rain last week, and Yamoussoukro, where it did not rain. In the western region of Soubre – which also had no rainfall last week – as well as Divo and Abengourou – where rainfall was below average – and Agboville – where rains were above average – farmers said they remained confident that crops would develop well.  The weekly average temperature across Ivory Coast last week ranged from 28.7 to 30.8 degrees Celsius. : Ivory Coast Cocoa Farmers Concerned Over Lack Of Rain Tags Cocoa Ivory Coast Cocoa Beans",2076,True,0
Pink flamingos 'seized from smugglers' in Tunisia - BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czx8qkdvqjwo,2025-02-10,"Ten endangered flamingos have been saved after smugglers were caught trying to traffic them out of Tunisia, according to the country's customs body. Photos of the birds crammed into crates with their wings, legs and torsos bound up were posted by the force online. The flamingos were rescued close to the Algerian border on Sunday, having been ""loaded onto a lorry bearing a Tunisian registration plate"", officials said in a statement. The birds have now been safely returned to their natural habitat, officials added, ""as part of efforts to preserve the species"". But is not clear what action is being taken against the purported smugglers. It is illegal to hunt or smuggle flamingos in Tunisia because they are protected by Tunisian law. Other threats to flamingos include pollution and rising temperatures caused by human-induced climate change, say conservationists, causing flamingos' wetland habitats to shrink. Yet there is some good news, as data gathered in the past decade has shown some population increases. Latest estimates suggest there are at least half a million greater flamingos - or Phoenicopterus roseus to use their scientific name - left in the wild. North Africa is one stop among many for these migratory birds, which are also spotted in Europe, West Africa and Asia. Bird-watching hotspots for flamingos include Djerba island off Tunisia's south-eastern coast, and Korba Lagoon further to the north. Go to BBCAfrica.com for",1448,True,0

""Had this been a case of human conflict, there would have been visible marks on the body,"" Mahto said.The possibility of electrocution was dismissed as there were no electrical installations near the site. Being a female elephant, poaching for tusks was also ruled out since female elephants don't possess tusks.The only notable finding was a blood clot in the elephant's trunk. ""We suspect the elephant might have encountered a venomous snake while trying to grab it with her trunk, resulting in a fatal bite,"" said Mahto.A team of three veterinary doctors conducted the post-mortem examination. Viscera samples have been preserved for forensic analysis to determine the exact cause of death.The carcass was buried at the site of death (in situ) using a JCB machine. The incident has raised concerns about wildlife safety in the region, though preliminary investigations suggest it was a natural death.Forest officials continue to monitor the area and await forensic results for a conclusive determination of the cause of death.

Leopard hide seized; six detained - OrissaPOST,https://www.orissapost.com/leopard-hide-seized-six-detained/,2025-02-08,"<strong>Baripada</strong>: A special team of the Forest department Friday seized a leopard skin under Karanjia forest division in Mayurbhanj district. Six individuals involved in the illegal trade of animal parts have been detained for questioning. According to sources, the wildlife criminals were trying to strike a deal in Nayak Sahi, Manduar, under the Karanjia forest range when officials received a tip-off. Acting on the directive of Karanjia Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Srikant Nayak, a special team was formed, and a raid was conducted, leading to the seizure of the hide. Preliminary investigation suggests the seized leopard skin is 2-3 years old. However, the exact time and circumstances of the leopard’s poaching remain under investigation. Officials have yet to determine the length and width of the hide. <h4>Also Read: <a href=""https://www.orissapost.com/247-kg-ganja-seized-from-koraput-kendu-leaf-godown/"">247 kg ganja seized from Koraput kendu leaf godown</a></h4> DFO Nayak speculated that the leopard was relatively young at the time of its death. A sample of the seized skin will be sent to the National Centre for Biological Sciences in Bangalore for further examination. The forensic report will confirm whether the tiger was male or female and provide insights into the cause of death. Authorities suspect an interstate wildlife trafficking network is operating in the region. Traders from neighbouring Jharkhand and West Bengal are believed to be luring locals into illegal activities, including the trade of tiger skins and elephant tusks. As a result, many gullible tribal people involved in poaching are being arrested and facing legal consequences. Conservation groups are calling for stricter patrolling in border areas to curb wildlife crime and protect endangered species. <strong>PNN</strong>",1831,True,0

France to Pull Troops From Ivory Coast in February: Sources - The Defense Post,https://thedefensepost.com/2025/02/07/france-pull-troops-ivory-coast/,2025-02-07,"France will hand back to Ivory Coast its only military base in the west African country in a ceremony on February 20, sources with knowledge of the talks told AFP on Thursday. Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara announced the planned withdrawal in December, making it the latest country in the region to weaken military ties with the former colonial power. ""The scheduled date is February 20. Ivory Coast is ready,"" said a source in Ivory Coast, with sources on the French side confirming the date. French Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu is expected to attend the official ceremony with his Ivorian counterpart Tene Birahima Ouattara. France has spent years preparing a ""reorganization"" of military relations after the forced departure of its troops from Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, where military-led governments hostile to the ex-colonial ruler have seized power in recent years. In November, Senegal and Chad also announced within hours of each other that they would bring to an end France's military presence. France and Ivory Coast have worked together on the handover of the base at Port-Bouet in commercial hub Abidjan - where French troops from the 43rd BIMA marine infantry battalion are stationed. About 1,000 French soldiers were deployed to help in particular with the fight against jihadists, who launch regular attacks across the wider region. Some 80 French troops are expected to remain at the Abidjan camp to carry out training exercises. Ivory Coast, the world's biggest cocoa producer which also has huge deposits of natural resources including oil, gas and gold, remains an important ally of France.",1628,True,0

You either stop and let it walk past or you get out of the way completely. The elephant sort of finds it as a game if you keep on reversing, almost taunting it.”Grobler said the elephant disappeared into the bush but the driver kept reversing, trying to keep pace with the pachyderm.“The car was trying to keep up with the elephant, and eventually the elephant came out and at first put its tusks the roof and then the trunk, and then it walked around it with the front legs on the left-hand side and the hind legs on the right-hand side, and then it just crushed the Polo,” Grobler said.“But it wasn’t trying to do damage.

The beads were part of elaborate dresses made out of linen and adorned with ivory and amber pendants, suggesting they were made for a select group of high-status women. Archaeologists excavated a large tomb, known as the Montelirio tholos burial, between 2010 and 2011 at the Valencina mega-site, located 3.7 miles (6 kilometers) from Seville. Valencina is a large Copper Age settlement, and the tholos tomb was used from about 2800 to 2600 B.C. Within the tomb, archaeologists discovered eight skeletons, seven of which were female. ""This type of tomb is not common in Iberia,"" Samuel Ramírez-Cruzado, a geoarchaeologist at the University of Seville in Spain, told Live Science in an email, and ""it is not normal in Iberia that the majority of human bodies inhumated in a single place are female."" To fully understand this unique tomb, Ramírez-Cruzado and colleagues spent five years meticulously studying its contents. They published their findings Jan. 29 in the journal Science Advances. The researchers carefully cleaned all of the tiny, disc-shaped beads, which weighed around 33 pounds (15 kilograms) altogether. In total, there were",1343,True,0

Since then, the season’s most illustrious stars have kept a surprisingly low profile. Angelina Jolie, for one, only steps out for grocery runs while she awaits the next A-list affair. But on Feb. 5, Jolie, one of this year’s most nominated actors, finally returned to the red carpet. On the second day of the 40th Annual Santa Barbara International Film Festival, the fashion muse donned a backless ivory dress to accept the Maltin Modern Master Award (the festival’s highest honor). Inside the Arlington Theatre in the heart of Santa Barbara, Jolie delivered her third step-and-repeat of 2025. The Maria star was a vision in a floor-length slip dress. Her silky style featured a straight-across high neckline, thin straps, and hidden pockets. Always on board for a monochrome moment, Jolie paired the little white dress with a complementary blazer, effortlessly draped atop her shoulders. Both pieces were courtesy of Brunello Cucinelli. Underneath the elongated hem peeked a pointy black pump from Aquazzura, adorned with transparent cutouts. Once Jolie removed her off-white jacket, all eyes went to her LWD’s plunging back. A thin horizontal silver strap stretched across the center of her back, which held the slip in place. Then, the fabric draped into a delicate cowl shape. This detail showcased her numerous back tattoos. In true Jolie fashion, she finished her ensemble with minimal jewelry — just gold diamond earrings.

He got that opportunity this year, when he spent six months at the University of Arkansas conducting research as a Fulbright Visiting Scholar. Komenan, an associate professor at Felix Houphouet-Boigny University in the Ivory Coast, researched at the U of A from April to October for his project on acclaimed South African and Nobel Prize winning author J.M. Coetzee. Specifically, the project examines how four of Coetzee's works - Elizabeth Costello, Slow Man, Diary of a Bad Year, and The Childhood of Jesus - represent ""innovative world writing"" characterized chiefly by globalized and innovative settings and writing rooted in literary, philosophical and cultural traditions. The U of A was the a perfect setting to conduct this research, given the campus's supportive academic environment which enhanced his work. Specifically, Komenan found the Mullins Library a wealth of resources and information. ""The Mullins Library proved to be a true gold mine, a source of invaluable scientific articles, dissertation theses, books and book chapters, from which I took many notes relevant to my research topic, which allowed me to write the first and second drafts of my monograph on Coetzee's four selected novels,"" he said. ""The availability of the freshly published resources on the studied works of fiction turned out to be helpful in the composition of the monograph on the 21st century cosmopolitan prose phenotexts by the well-known Afro-Australian novelist."" He also audited a class from professors including Jarvis A. Young, assistant professor of African American literature, on ""Topics in African American Literature and Culture,"" where he gained a deeper appreciation of American literature. But Komenan's Fulbright experience also extended beyond academia. He participated in cultural exchange with local residents through the iFriend program and attended campus activities coordinated by the Office of International Students and Scholars. He also traveled during his time in the States, visiting the Omaha Zoo, Walmart Museum in Bentonville, Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, and landmarks in New York City, among others. He credited Dr. Lindsey Aloia, associate dean in the Graduate School and International Education and his faculty associate and research mentor, for facilitating his experience at the U of A.

Banning wildlife trade can increase trade of other threatened species - The Conversation,https://theconversation.com/banning-wildlife-trade-can-increase-trade-of-other-threatened-species-247148,2025-04-15,"Seized ivory tusks are destroyed by the Malaysian government as part of its fight against the illegal ivory trade. MIFAS/Shutterstock Governments often use bans to protect wildlife that’s most threatened by trade. However, in our recent study we ask the question: could banning wildlife trade in one threatened species increase the trade in other threatened species? The expansion of online markets has made it easier for people to buy and sell wildlife. This potential for larger-scale commercial trade creates a potential threat to wildlife, particular when populations are small, which is often the case for species that inhabit islands. To deal with the risk of overexploitation, the government of Japan, one of the world’s largest wildlife markets, banned the trade of three threatened species: the giant water bug, the Tokyo salamander and the golden venus chub. While the ban successfully halted legal sales of the policy-targeted species, it had an unintended consequence: an increase in the sales of similar, non-banned species, some of which are threatened. This pattern, known as the “spillover effect”, suggests that when a species is no longer available, demand often moves to alternative species rather than disappearing entirely. However, these effects affected different species in different ways, with the spillover lasting for",1344,True,0

(Credit: Wikipedia.) ListenYAOUNDÉ, Cameroon – Catholic bishops in the Ivory Coast, also called Côte d’Ivoire, have called on the electoral commission to ensure “free, fair, transparent, credible, and inclusive elections” as the nation prepares for general elections in October. The prelates made the appeal at the conclusion of their Plenary Assembly, held from January 20 to January 26 in Boudoukou, in the eastern part of the country. They emphasized that a transparent and credible election would inspire public confidence in the electoral process and help prevent the post-electoral violence that has historically plagued the West African nation. One of the worst post-electoral crises in Ivory Coast was recorded between 2010-2011. Supporters of incumbent President Laurent Gbagbo and challenger Alassane Ouattara clashed over disputed election outcomes, resulting in the deaths of at least 3000 people, and the displacement of tens of thousands of Ivoirians. Gbago himself was arrested in April 2011 and transferred to The Hague in November that year after the deadly violence caused by his refusal to accept defeat by Alassane Ouattara. He was accused of crimes against humanity. Fast forward to the 2020 presidential election and the threat of violence loomed large once again. President Alassane Ouattara’s controversial bid for a third term deemed unconstitutional by the opposition, ignited widesp honest in the exercise of their functions and activities.” “This recommendation requires integrity and resistance to all attempts at corruption and pressure, in order to avoid compromising their ethical responsibility to the nation,” the bishops said in their declaration. “The conference encourages politicians to respect the values of integrity and decency, while condemning all forms of vote buying and selling, which it considers illegal and inadmissible. It also advises political parties and actors to refrain from such practices,” the statement continues. The bishops’ concerns have also been raised by the United Nations Office for West Africa and the Sahel. In December, it encouraged “national stakeholders and election management bodies in Côte d’Ivoire to intensify their efforts to reach a consensus and ensure that the 2025 elections are inclusive and participatory, with electoral processes and specific solutions that respond to the aspirations of the population.” Several political figures have al deaths, we want to sing of hope,” they said.",2605,True,0

Members of the Episcopal Conference of Ivory Coast (CECCI) have called on the country’s politicians to focus on unity and peace ahead of the country’s presidential elections scheduled for October this year. In a message issued at the end of their 126th Plenary Assembly on January 26, CECCI members underscore the need for a peaceful and fair electoral process, urging politicians to rekindle the nation’s hope. With the presidential elections just months away, the Catholic Bishops warn that the behavior of the population and politicians leading to the elections will be pivotal for the country’s future. “There is no doubt that the Ivorian nation is at a crossroads in this Jubilee year, which is also an election year. The way its sons and daughters conduct themselves during this period will be crucial for its survival,” CECCI members say. They express concern about potential political unrest, before, during, or after the elections. CECCI members also announce that they would issue a pastoral letter to the nation to guide the people through these challenging times. While acknowledging the President’s commitment to fair elections, the Catholic Bishops call on the Independent Electoral Commission (CEI) to “do everything possible to guarantee free, fair, transparent, credible, and inclusive elections in order to strengthen citizens’ trust in the electoral process.” The Catholic Bishops also urge political leaders to uphold integrity, condemning all forms of vote-buying, which they described as illegal and harmful to the democratic process. “Since politics is a noble vocation dedicated to serving the common good, the Conference of Catholic Bishops of Côte d'Ivoire (CECCI) encourages all politicians to uphold values of integrity and decency,” the Catholic Church leaders say. They “strongly condemn all forms of vote-buying and selling, which it considers illegal and unacceptable.” CECCI members also advise all political actors and voters to “abstain from such practices.” They add, “While the CECCI, as an institution of the Catholic hierarchy in Côte d'Ivoire, does not dictate to political parties their choice of presidential candidates, it has a duty to remind citizens to consider the implications of their choices during the elections.” The Catholic Bishops encourage Ivorians to “turn their attention to God through prayer and fasting so that both the government and the opposition may take the right actions and make strong decisions to save the nation.” They call on their fellow citizens to “continue fasting and praying in preparation for peaceful and trouble-free elections.” CECCI members also exhort political leaders, during campaigns and vote-seeking efforts, to “avoid all forms of violence and to refrain from exploiting religion and ethnicity for political gain.” CECCI members recommend that “regulatory bodies exercise greater vigilance and honesty in fulfilling their duties.” “This recommendation requires them to act with integrity, resist all attempts at corruption and undue pressure, and thus avoid compromising their ethical responsibility to the nation,” the Catholic Bishops say. They call for “respect for the separation of powers—executive, legislative, and judicial—to ensure balance and justice in governance.” CECCI members remind citizens that Christ must be at the center of their lives and decision-making, including in the choice of leaders. “If Christ is our hope, then we must make room for Him to guide and direct all aspects of our collective life, including the election of our leaders and conflict management,” they say. (Story continues below) The Catholic Bishops continue, “If we succeed in this, we will have revived the hope of the""Land of Hope, as proclaimed in our national anthem.

UK Ivory Act extends protections to ban all trade in ivory from hippos and three whale species - EIA,https://eia-international.org/news/uk-ivory-act-extends-protections-to-ban-all-trade-in-ivory-from-hippos-and-three-whale-species/,2025-01-30,"The UK’s landmark Ivory Act has been extended to offer protection to an additional four species. EIA UK Executive Director Mary Rice welcomed the move, stating: “The UK Ivory Act was a long, tough fight to achieve and well worth the effort as it proved to be one of the world’s toughest and most comprehensive ivory bans. “Until now it has applied only to the ivory of elephants, so we’re delighted to see its scope expanded to include hippos and some cetaceans whose ivory is all too often found in illegal trade.” EIA played a crucial role in leading a coalition of environmental groups to secure the Act after our research revealed in 2017 that the UK was the world’s leading exporter of antique ivory and our campaigners are delighted to see it expanded. The Act came into force on 6 June 2022, effectively outlawing all legal ivory trade apart from a few narrow exemptions. Under the Act, it is illegal to deal in almost all of the UK in items made of, or containing, elephant ivory, regardless of their age. There are a number of carefully crafted, limited and certified exemptions which include portrait miniatures, musical instruments, items with low ivory content, sales to qualifying museums and rare/important items. Penalties for dealing in ivory now include fines of up to £250,000 or up to five years’ imprisonment. This week, the UK Government confirmed that the scope of the Act has been extended to now ban the importing, exporting and dealing in items containing ivory from hippos, narwhals and killer and sperm whales, stating: “Closing domestic ivory markets is a critical part of the UK’s global conservation efforts. Hippopotamus is the species most at extinction risk from the trade in its ivory, after elephants.” Narwhals EIA Ocean Campaigner Sarah Dolman added: “This move will level protection in the UK for orca, narwhal, sperm whale and hippopotamus, all ivory-bearing species. It will help prevent ivory demand shifting from one vulnerable species to another. “A narwhal is a medium-sized whale, hunted under quotas in Canada and Greenland. Males and some females have a long protruding tusk that projects from their upper left jaw. Narwhal tusks,",2177,True,0

While ivory from hippopotamus, sperm whale, orca, and narwhal forms a significantly smaller part of the UK ivory trade that that from elephants, it’s anticipated that the extension of the Act should help to improve its enforcement and reduce the opportunity for illegally-obtained elephant ivory to be covertly sold. There have been concerns that, since the full implementation of the ban on the trade of ivory obtained from elephants in 2022, other species would face increased pressures. While walrus was originally considered among the species to be added to the Ivory Act, walrus ivory will continue to be restricted under existing seal products legislation which covers products from seals, walruses, and sea lions including fur, blubber, tusks, or oil. Born Free, a conservation organisation which has been campaigning for greater protections for wild animals from the ivory trade for decades, played an instrumental part in the expansion of the UK’s Ivory Act. “Encouragingly, our recent investigations into the online ivory trade suggest the Ivory Act has significantly reduced the number of elephant ivory items being listed on popular auction websites,” said Born Free’s policy support officer, Frankie Osuch. “So, there appears to be a high level of compliance with the Act and its exemption criteria. We hope that today’s extension will further strengthen the Ivory Act and we’ll continue to monitor its impact.”  for",1925,True,0

The team cleaned, weighed, quantified, measured and studied the beads, which were fairly uniform in size and shape, to understand how and why they were made, García Sanjuán said. “They would have been extremely glittery under the sunlight and that would have been a very powerful effect to see these women standing in front of a crowd performing whatever rituals they were in charge of performing,” he added.

Water for wild elephants - Deccan Herald,https://www.deccanherald.com/opinion/water-for-wild-elephants-3377226,2025-01-29,"&lt;p&gt;In seasons or certain periods that are prone to heat or prolonged droughts, providing water&nbsp;for wild animals may become important for maintaining ecological balance. Access to water&nbsp;ensures hydration, thermoregulation, and sustenance for various species, thereby mitigating&nbsp;the impacts of environmental stressors and promoting biodiversity conservation.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;While&nbsp;people in urban areas of Karnataka worry about the lack of rains, there is also growing&nbsp;concern for the non-humans in the forested habitats. Often provisioning of water either&nbsp;through tankers or solar powered borewells inside the forests for elephants and other&nbsp;animals to quench their thirst during the dry season is considered an act of benevolence and&nbsp;a critical management tool to arrest deaths due to dehydration. Yet, studies conducted&nbsp;in the forests of southern India and in Africa have begun to show that such well-meaning interventions can have unforeseen and detrimental consequences to the&nbsp;elephants and its habitat.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief, water availability in human-provisioned water ponds or troughs&nbsp;within the forests of the Eastern Ghats of southern India (a dry zone) appears to have a&nbsp;weak but positive influence on the distribution of elephants during the dry season and has&nbsp;no effect on their distribution in the wet season.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Studies further reveal that the decision-making rules of elephants in the dry zone prioritise accessing areas with high forage&nbsp;availability and avoiding areas with high human activity during this season well over water&nbsp;sources. This may very well be due to the presence of perennial water sources such as the&nbsp;Cauvery and other rivers in the landscape that is used by wild animals during the drier&nbsp;months of the year. Wild animals such as elephants very often resort to digging small pits or&nbsp;wells using their feet, tusks and trunks to access water beneath the surface of dry sandy&nbsp;riverbeds too.&lt;/p&gt;.Elephant camp project awaits govt funds.&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, in the Western Ghats, research indicates that elephants exhibit a preference for natural water sources such as rivers and flowing streams during the dry season. Contrary to expectations, elephants are not necessarily drawn to human-made water troughs, highlighting the importance of preserving natural hydrological features in elephant habitats.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;The artificial provisioning of water may disrupt natural behavioural patterns, fracturing the migratory behaviour of elephants who rely on rivers and streams as navigational cues. This disruption may have cascading effects on ecosystem dynamics, leading to habitat degradation and altered vegetation patterns. These findings call into question the necessity of artificial water provisioning for elephants, who naturally travel&nbsp;long distances and are migratory in nature.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preserving natural sources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Evidence from the Kruger National Park in South Africa corroborates the detrimental&nbsp;effects of artificial water provisioning on elephant behaviour and ecosystem health. Artificial&nbsp;water points disrupted the traditional migration routes, confining elephants to localised&nbsp;areas and exacerbating habitat degradation.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;The concentration of elephants around water&nbsp;troughs led to overgrazing and destruction of natural vegetation, further exacerbating&nbsp;ecological imbalances within the park, affecting multiple other species. In the Okavango&nbsp;delta of Botswana, stagnant water in water bodies became breeding grounds for toxic&nbsp;bacteria such as blue-green algae, posing a lethal threat to elephants. The mass die-off of&nbsp;close to 400 elephants in Botswana attributed to the cyanobacterial poisoning in 2020 by some studies serves as&nbsp;a stark reminder of such perils.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;The priority of the forest managers would therefore lie in the preservation of natural water&nbsp;sources to safeguard elephant populations and ecosystem integrity. Ensuring free access to&nbsp;rivers and streams – preferred water sources for elephants during the dry&nbsp;season – is paramount. The artificial provisioning of water may also disrupt natural mortality&nbsp;rates, favouring the survival of weaker individuals at the expense of genetic diversity. Under&nbsp;unfavourable weather conditions, natural selection acts as a mechanism for ensuring the&nbsp;survival of the fittest individuals and perpetuating strong genetic lineages. Hence dying of&nbsp;elephants during such periods is natural and is a necessary mechanism through which populations&nbsp;are controlled naturally.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;The scientific evidence available thus far indicates that artificial provisioning, although&nbsp;practised with the best of intentions, has adverse effects on elephant behaviour, ecosystem&nbsp;dynamics, and genetic fitness. We must therefore re-evaluate current management&nbsp;practices while prioritising the preservation of natural water sources to maintain ecological&nbsp;balance and promote the long-term viability of elephant populations. By refraining from&nbsp;interventions and allowing natural processes to unfold, we can uphold the integrity of&nbsp;ecosystems and ensure the survival of elephants in their natural habitats.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;This is all the",5494,True,0

Its landscapes range from the snow-covered Himalayas to dense rainforests of Western ghats, from the arid deserts of Rajasthan to the Sundarbans’ green mangroves. India’s ecosystems support an incredible variety of flora and fauna so much so that it is one of the seventeen megadiverse countries worldwide, hosting 7-8% of all recorded species, even though it has only 2.4% of the world’s landmass. However, this exceptional biodiversity faces constant risks. Rapid industrialisation process, urbanisation and population growth have resulted in habitat loss at significant levels, with pollution and human-wildlife conflicts on the rise. In India, wildlife conservation is not only considered for animals but is also a part of broader developmental objectives. For instance, the preservation of healthy ecosystems with high levels of diversification is key to maintaining balance in nature by securing clean air and water supplies, ensuring crop pollination, and making the environment resilient to climate change. These includes preserving overall bio-resiliency against global warming effects.",2127,True,0
Study tracks hunting trends in Africa's biodiverse forests - People Daily,https://peopledaily.digital/news/study-tracks-hunting-trends-in-africas-biodiverse-forests,2025-01-29,"News Study tracks hunting trends in Africa’s biodiverse forests Wednesday 29th January, 2025 07:20 AM| By Alberto Leny Vendors selling fruit bats in Brazzaville often use their teeth to debone the bats’ wings for customers. Bats are common vectors for many diseases. PHOTO/NATional GEOgraphic/Brent Stirton Increased commercial hunting and associated depletion of large-bodied wildlife in African tropical forests, is a source of critical environmental concerns, a ground-breaking new study on wildlife hunting has revealed. The study was published on January 7 in Nature Sustainability by lead authors Daniel Ingram (Durrell Institute of Conservation of Ecology, University of Kent), Katharine Abernethy (University of Stirling), John Scharlemann (formerly University of Sussex), and Centre for International Forestry Research and World Agroforestry (CIFOR-ICRAF) scientist Lauren Coad. The study’s findings seek urgent action to reverse the concerning trends, according to Coad, co-author and scientist at the Nairobi-based CIFOR-ICRAF. “Sustainable wildlife management solutions, coupled with continued long-term monitoring, are urgently needed to preserve Central Africa’s wildlife resources,” said Coad of the report whose findings were enabled by advances in data availability and accessibility. Several organisations collaborated in the CIFOR-ICRAF-supported study, including the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and the Institut de Recherche en Ecologie Tropicale (IRET). It is the first study to explore the factors that influence wild animal hunting patterns across African tropical forests in detail, and on a regional scale. Other than hunting, wildlife trade and tracking is a major environmental and animal health concern, increasingly so in the climate change era. With an estimated US$7-23 billion per year, wildlife tracking is the world’s fourth most profitable clandestine market after tracking in counterfeit goods, drugs and people, according to the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The hunting and consumption of wild animals is one of the principal ways by which many zoonotic agents are transmitted to humans. The uncontrolled hunting and consumption of wild animals poses great risks to hunters and consumers alike. The development of new urban areas and infrastructure for activities such as mining facilitates smugglers and hunters’ access to wildlife. Deadlier encounters Many wild animals are sold for their meat, skin, teeth (elephant tusks as ivory), rhino horns or nails, or as pets and are raised in extremely adverse and stressful conditions. They come into contact with each other and humans in uncontrolled environments, making the emergence of infectious diseases inevitable. The research made extensive use of wildmeat.org, the largest compilation of African hunting data to date, to explore the socio-cultural, economic and landscape variables associated with wild animal hunting across 115 settlements in African tropical forests. Through a synthesis of 83 studies published between 2001-2020, researchers found startling evidence. Village hunters increasingly use guns instead of traditional tools (for example spears) and traps, which makes it easier to target commercially viable species.

UK ivory ban extension comes into force - Born Free Foundation,https://www.bornfree.org.uk/news/uk-ivory-ban-extension-comes-into-force/,2025-01-28,"Born Free celebrates as the UK Ivory Act extension enforces a near total ban on the import, export and selling of hippo, narwhal, sperm whale and orca ivory. You’ve been with us every step of our campaign and thankfully, from today, it’s now illegal to sell ivory from hippopotamus, narwhal, sperm whale and orca (also known as killer whale), unless items meet narrow exemption criteria. Dealing in ivory from these species is now subject to the same restrictions as elephant ivory, which came into force under the Ivory Act in June 2022, after years of Born Free campaigning. All four additional species are listed under the United Nations’ Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), with hippo and sperm whale also categorised as ‘Vulnerable to extinction’ on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. While this ivory forms a significantly smaller part of the UK ivory trade than that from elephants, extending the Ivory Act to non-elephant ivory-bearing species should help improve the enforcement of the Act. It will reduce the opportunity for illegally-obtained elephant ivory to be covertly sold – by disguising it as being from another ivory-bearing species. For hippos, there are further concerns that demand for their ivory may increase in response to elephant ivory bans, increasing pressure on wild populations. The new regulations aim to reduce the ‘commodification’ of ivory products (turning them into items that can be bought or sold), so do not prohibit owners from keeping, gifting or bequeathing their ivory items. While walrus was originally considered among the species to be added to the Ivory Act, walrus ivory will continue to be restricted under existing seal products legislation (ie products from seals, walruses and sea lions including fur, blubber, tusks or oil). However, warthogs were not considered for this extension. While both species of warthog are listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, trade in warthog products is not currently regulated under CITES and their populations are decreasing. Therefore, the ongoing trade in their tusks in the UK needs to be closely monitored to ensure they are not being targeted as substitutes for elephant ivory. Extending the Act further to cover ivory from extinct species including mammoths also needs to be considered. While mammoths have been extinct for thousands of years, tonnes of mammoth tusks preserved in the Siberian permafrost are harvested and traded each year. Mammoth and elephant ivory can look very similar, and may need to be distinguished by experts. Therefore, there is concern that continuing to allow the trade in mammoth ivory will enable illegal traders to launder ivory from elephants by disguising it as mammoth ivory. “Encouragingly, our recent investigations into the online ivory trade suggest that the Ivory Act has significantly reduced the number of elephant ivory items being listed on popular auction websites,” said Born Free’s Policy Support Officer Frankie Osuch. “So there appears to be a high level of compliance with the Act and its exemption criteria.

Ivory Coast expects dire cocoa mid-crop as chocolate industry braces for rough year,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1276104-ivory-coast-expects-dire-cocoa-mid-crop-as-chocolate-industry-braces-for-rough-year,2025-07-26,"Cocoa pods are seen at a farm in Daloa, Ivory Coast, on Oct. 2, 2023. — Reuters Ivory Coast expects to record one of the worst mid-crop cocoa harvests of the last 15 years this season with production seen no higher than 300,000 metric tonnes compared with a yearly average of 500,000 tonnes, regulator and industry sources said.A poor harvest could add upward pressure to cocoa prices, which are already around record highs after nearly tripling last year. Analysts have said the chocolate industry is in for a rough 2025 that could see shelf prices hiked by a teens percentage.Ivory Coast is the world’s top cocoa producer but a lack of rain and excessive heat since November across all of its 13 growing regions have stalled development of the mid-crop harvest, which is meant to start in April. The unfavourable conditions mean that the first beans will only start to arrive in ports in June at the earliest, provided the weather improves and rains return in the coming weeks, the sources said.“There is a consensus that current climatic conditions are so unfavourable that the mid-crop harvest will not exceed 300,000 tonnes. There is no sign of any production at all on almost any plantation in the country,” said a pod counter who had just visited Ivory Coast’s farms.His words echo those of two regulator officials, who said that after touring farms their team decided to lower the outlook for cocoa production to 300,000 metric tonnes from 400,000 tonnes.“Like everyone else, we’re seeing the same thing.

The farmer said while the harvest was expected to start in April, there will be no cocoa until at least June.“Usually, it’s around November and December that we get the rains that herald the mid-crop harvest, but this year there’s been no rain so far, and February and March are the hottest months,” said another pod counter.He visited dozens of plantations that did not have any sign of flowers or pods, which he called “very bad news” for the crop.

But this isn’t just any artifact. This comb is one of the oldest pieces of alphabetic writing ever discovered—and its story is as fascinating as it is rare. The ivory comb contains the oldest sentence ever written in alphabetic script. Since the alphabet was invented before this comb, its date is significant. This is important because 75% of the world’s population still uses alphabetic writing today, which underscores the lasting impact of this development, said Michael G. Hasel. This ivory comb has journeyed far to be here. What makes it truly extraordinary, however, isn’t just its age—it’s the inscription carved into its surface, making it a rare treasure in the field of archaeology. The inscription reads, “May this ivory (tusk) root out the lice of the hair and the beard.” What’s particularly interesting is that when Dr. Manshu analyzed the comb under a microscope, she found a tiny piece of the exoskeleton of a lice trapped between the teeth. This discovery is fascinating and confirms that the comb was indeed designed for its intended purpose, said Michael. FacebookPinterestTwitterLinkedin This content provided by:",1376,True,0
Chocolate industry braces as Ivory Coast expects dire cocoa crop - VOA,https://www.voanews.com/a/chocolate-industry-braces-as-ivory-coast-expects-dire-cocoa-crop/7948916.html,2025-01-24,"Languages Search Previous Next Breaking News Africa Chocolate industry braces as Ivory Coast expects dire cocoa crop January 24, 2025 10:03 AM By Reuters FILE - Cocoa pods are seen at a farm in Daloa, Ivory Coast, on Oct. 2, 2023. Experts say the 2025 mid-crop cocoa harvest will be down about 40% from the yearly average. Ivory Coast expects to record one of the worst mid-crop cocoa harvests of the last 15 years this season with production seen no higher than 300,000 metric tons compared with a yearly average of 500,000 tons, regulator and industry sources said. A poor harvest could add upward pressure to cocoa prices, which are already around record highs after nearly tripling last year. Analysts have said the chocolate industry is in for a rough 2025 that could see shelf prices increase by a percentage in the teens. Ivory Coast is the world's top cocoa producer, but a lack of rain and excessive heat since November across all its 13 growing regions have stalled development of the mid-crop harvest, which is meant to start in April. The unfavorable conditions mean that the first beans will start to arrive in ports in June at the earliest, provided the weather improves and rains return in the coming weeks, the sources said. ""There is no sign of any production at all on almost any plantation in the country,"" said a pod counter who had just visited Ivory Coast farms. His words echo those of two regulator officials, who said that after touring farms their team decided to lower the outlook for cocoa production to 300,000 metric tons from 400,000 tons. ""Like everyone else, we're seeing the same thing. The mid-crop harvest will be one of the worst in 15 years,"" one of the officials said. He added that the regulator had sold only about 250,000 tons in export contracts to grinders, preferring to be cautious. The regulator sources said the entire mid-crop harvest would be sold to local grinders to guarantee them the volumes necessary to maintain their activity. A dozen planters and middlemen across the West African country described the situation as unprecedented, characterized by a total absence of flowers and small pods after those that appeared in December and January dried up in the high heat.

Ivory Coast man indicted for sextortion scheme - Minot Daily News,https://www.minotdailynews.com/news/local-news/2025/01/ivory-coast-man-indicted-for-sextortion-scheme/,2025-01-24,"BISMARCK — An Ivory Coast man has been indicted by a federal grand jury for participating in a sextortion scheme which caused the death of a North Dakota teenager, according to U.S. Attorney Mac Schneider’s office. Schneider announced the indictment on Wednesday of Aly Cherif, 23, on charges of cyberstalking, resulting in death, wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, extortion and distribution of child pornography. The unsealed indictment alleges Cherif and other individuals located in the Ivory Coast participated in a well-organized sextortion group that targeted victims throughout the world. Cherif and his group allegedly targeted a N.D. teenager with a fraudulent social media account posing as a woman who lived in Montana named “Emily Thompson.” The sextortion group obtained a video recording and photographs of the teenage victim and used extortion tactics to attempt to force the teenage victim to pay money so “Emily Thompson” would not release the content. When the teenage victim informed them that they did not have any money, the sextortion group distributed images of the victim’s private parts on social media. The teenage victim committed suicide shortly thereafter. “The United States Attorney’s Office and our partners in law enforcement are committed to obtaining a measure of justice for this family,” Schneider said. “The indictment alleges greed, deception, and child exploitation that led to a heartrending tragedy. As we pursue justice in this case, we want to deter similar conduct and remind kids and families that help is available if they become victims of sextortion.” The case is being investigated by the FBI, Department of Homeland Security-Homeland Security Investigations, and is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Jonathan J. O’Konek. To report a sextortion scam, contact a local FBI field office at 1-800-CALL-FBI.

Specifically, sextortioners perpetrating sextortion schemes utilize false claims to induce victims to send photographs or videos of themselves—or to engage in video chats where the sextortioners record victims—nude or engaged in private, intimate, or sexual acts, and then the sextortioners threaten to release these photographs or videos to friends, family, work colleagues, or threaten to post these photographs or videos on the internet, unless the victim pays money to the sextortioners.Additionally, as alleged in the Indictment, Cherif and others in the sextortion group targeted a North Dakota teenager by obtaining publicly available photographs of an attractive woman from the internet and then fraudulently used these photographs to create or modify a Facebook account to falsely pose as a woman named “Emily Thompson.” Thereafter, the sextortion group contacted the minor victim through Facebook chat and falsely stated that they were “Emily Thompson,” and that “Emily Thompson” was twenty (20) years old and lived in Montana, when in fact, Cherif and the sextortion group were operating this Facebook account, not a woman named “Emily Thompson.” Next, the sextortion group obtained a video recording and photographs of the minor victim engaging in a private, intimate, or sexual act, and used extortion tactics to attempt to force the minor victim to pay money so that “Emily Thompson” would not release videos and photographs of the minor victim engaging in these acts. When the minor victim informed “Emily Thompson,” that the minor victim did not have any money, the sextortion group distributed images of the minor victim’s genitalia on Facebook. Shortly thereafter, the minor victim committed suicide.“The United States Attorney’s Office and our partners in law enforcement are committed to obtaining a measure of justice for this family,” Schneider said. “The indictment alleges greed, deception, and child exploitation that led to a heartrending tragedy. As we pursue justice in this case, we want to deter similar conduct and remind kids and families that help is available if they become victims of sextortion.”""This case is a stark reminder of the dangers children face online, where predators use deception and technology to exploit the most vulnerable among us,"" said Special Agent in Charge Alvin M.

According to the preliminary investigations, the animal was shot dead by poachers for its tusks. According to forensic experts, the elephant had bullet wounds on both sides of its head, and its tusks, ears, tail and around 500 kg of meat were removed. Officials, including Officer-in-Charge Kalyanpur police station, Tapas Malakar and Sub-Divisional Forest Officer Gaurav R. Wagh, visited the site with forensic teams.

Conservation officials have welcomed this “positive” trend but warn that various threats persist in the region. The survey was conducted by WWF in collaboration with Cameroon’s Ministry of Forestry and Wildlife in Boumba Bek National Park, Nki National Park, and nearby logging concessions and communal forests, covering a total area of 1.08 million hectares (2.68 million acres). It found an estimated 1,004 forest elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis) and 19,472 great apes (gorillas and chimps). The results further revealed that elephant density in the parks is 68% greater than in nearby logging concessions. However, the total elephant density in the parks still remains lower than in other protected areas in the Congo Basin. Meanwhile, the population of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in Nki National Park tripled, and that of western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) increased slightly in both parks. “The situation is positive,” says Gilles Etoga, conservation director at WWF Cameroon. “The fauna potential of Boumba Bek and Nki continues to be present and representative of the fauna and the great mammals of the Cameroonian forest and is quite well distributed over the two parks and their peripheral areas.” The region’s forest elephants were hit hard in the past.

An ivory comb with the oldest deciphered complete alphabetic sentence in writing will be on display at Southern Adventist University. This artifact dates back to 1700 B.C., and was excavated in Israel by Southern Adventist archaeologists in 2016.

This artifact was also featured in The New York Times, Smithsonian, CNN, and BBC. “The find cannot be overestimated. The invention of the alphabet was the most important contribution to communication in the last four millennia.

Ivory Coast Holds Ammonium Nitrate Cargo Offshore as Concerns Continues,https://maritime-executive.com/article/ivory-coast-holds-ammonium-nitrate-cargo-offshore-as-concerns-continues,,"Ivory Coast Holds Ammonium Nitrate Cargo Offshore as Concerns Continues Port of Abidjan is holding the cargo ship laden with ammonium nitrate offshore (Port of Abidjan file photo) Published Jan 6, 2025 12:28 PM by The Maritime Executive The Port of Abidjan in the Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire) has decided to hold the cargo ship laden with ammonium nitrate offshore while it reviews safety concerns raised in the community and the local media. It is a continuation of the drama that began in September with bulker Ruby and now with the cargo transferred to the Barbados-flagged cargo ship Zimrida (37,296 dwt). Concerns were reported in the Ivory Coast that the cargo aboard the vessel might have become contaminated and possibly unstable. The vessel took board nearly all the 20,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate fertilizer that was first shipped from Russia last summer. The first ship, Ruby (37,000 dwt) was damaged in an Arctic storm and sought refuge in Norway. It was denied multiple ports before finally being permitted to offload its cargo in Great Yarmouth in the UK. Serenity Ship Management based in the UAE which manages Ruby arranged for the cargo to be transferred to another vessel it manages, Zimrida, as part of the agreement. However, it came out in the British press that some of the cargo had been contaminated with fuel oil. That portion was reportedly dumped by the Ruby into the North Sea. However, concerns are being raised in Abidjan that the cargo aboard the Zimrida might also be contaminated. Port officials in a statement on January 4 said they had decided to hold the vessel offshore while they were meeting on Monday, January 6, with the buyer of the cargo, the carrier, and customs officials. Zimrida had arrived off Ivory Coast on December 30 and had been scheduled to dock this afternoon local time, January 6, in Abidjan. According to the statement, the plan was to offload 3,000 tons of the fertilizer which is in bags. There was no information on where the remainder of the cargo would be going. The port highlights that ammonium nitrate is a regular fertilizer and that all cargoes landed are subject to strict safety protocols. They said the port of Abidjan handled 20,000 tons of traffic in 2023 and 38,000 tons in 2024. “This is the place to reassure the Ivorian populations that all goods, entering or disembarking in Ivorian ports, are subject to diligent control by the competent State services, which constantly monitor the health and safety of the populations,” the port authority wrote in its statement. As of late Monday afternoon, local time, the Zimrida continues to wait offshore according to its AIS signal.",2654,True,0
Ivory Coast weather mixed for cocoa mid-crop farmers - CNBC Africa,https://www.cnbcafrica.com/wire/655642/,,"Ivory Coast weather mixed for cocoa mid-crop farmers By Loucoumane Coulibaly ABIDJAN, Jan 6 (Reuters) – Variable rainfall last week across Ivory Coast’s main cocoa regions has contributed to a mixed outlook for the development of the April-to-September mid-crop as the main crop tails off, farmers said on Monday. Ivory Coast, the world’s top cocoa producer, is in its dry season which runs officially from mid-November to March, when rains are poor and scarce. In the western region of Soubre, where rains were well above average, farmers said the moisture would help cocoa trees flower from February, boosting hopes of a sustained and abundant mid-crop. The development of the mid-crop “is off to a good start.

The Ivory Coast forward has experience of playing in India having previously donned colours for Real Kashmir, Bhawanipore and Churchill during the 2021-22 season. He last played for Karbala'a FC in the top-tier Iraq Stars League.Spanish midfielder Juan Mera has also left the club, prompting Churchill to look for two new foreign players during this window.“Krizo is back at Churchill Brothers and we are still working on the other foreign player,” a senior club official told TOI on Sunday. “We are looking at other positions for the second foreigner and not a straightforward replacement for Juan Mera.”Juan, a I-League champion with Punjab FC, had limited minutes during his time at the club, as coach Dimitris Dimitriou’s looked at other foreign options which were available to him. Club sources said “Juan’s playing style did not fit into the coach’s philosophy.”Dimitriou’s has opted for Sebastian Gutierrez in the attacking midfield role and the Colombian has lived up to his reputation with some inspiring performances. Pape Gassama (Senegal) is an automatic choice in midfield.England striker Kurtis Guthrie raise expectations as he joined Churchill from Scottish Premiership side Livingston FC, the first instance of a player headed to the I-League straight from the Scottish top tier. For the I-League, though, Dimitriou’s first-choice striker has been South African striker Wayde Lekay, who is now the leading scorer with five strikes.“This is a real family-run club, and (club owner) Churchill Alemao wants to see his club in the ISL (Indian Super League). It is a club that has won the I-League multiple times. I was chosen as the leader of this attempt to win again. I’ve given him my word that I will give it my all,” said Dimitriou.Churchill are leading the I-League table with 13 points from their six matches, which includes impressive wins against initial favourites",2717,True,0

The West African country confirmed that French troops, stationed in the region for decades, would begin withdrawing from Ivorian soil this month. This marks another shift in the growing trend across Africa, where former colonial powers are seeing a reduction in their military presence. In a statement, Ivorian President Alassane Ouattara confirmed that the withdrawal would begin promptly, with the handover of the French Marines Infantry Battalion (BIMA) base in Port-Bouët to Ivorian forces slated for January 2025. ""It is within this framework that we have decided on the withdrawal of French forces in Ivory Coast,"" Ouattara said, adding that the 43rd BIMA base would be returned to the Ivorian military by early 2025. At its peak, France maintained up to 600 troops in Ivory Coast, underscoring the long-standing military partnership between the two nations. However, this move is part of a broader pattern across West Africa, where several countries have called for the removal of French military personnel. These requests reflect a wider shift in the region’s political landscape, as many African nations seek to redefine their relationship with former colonial powers. The decision to scale down military cooperation with France comes amid a rising wave of anti-French sentiment in several African countries, particularly in the Sahel and West Africa.

The Baleine field's phase 2 production is set to reach 60,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) along with 70 million cubic feet of associated gas, which is equivalent to two million cubic metres. This increase in output underscores the rapid progression of the project and Eni's commitment to efficient project execution. The deployment will also see the floating production, storage and offloading unit (FPSO) Petrojarl Kong and the floating storage and offloading unit (FSO) Yamoussoukro will facilitate the export of oil. Meanwhile, the entirety of the processed gas is slated to meet local energy demands, connecting to the infrastructure established during the project's first phase. The final investment decision for the Baleine field was made in December 2022, with phase 1 commencing in August 2023. The Baleine field is recognised as Africa's first upstream project to achieve net-zero emissions for Scope 1 and 2. This milestone is the result of implementing advanced technologies and collaborative efforts with Ivorian government ministries. The initiatives include a clean cooking programme that has reached over 575,000 people and efforts to protect and restore 14 classified forests, both contributing to the project's carbon neutrality. Eni has been operating in Côte d'Ivoire since 2015, currently producing approximately 22,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd). The company manages ten blocks (CI-101, CI-205, CI-401, CI-501, CI-801, CI-802, CI-504, CI-526, CI-706 and CI-708) in the Ivorian deep waters alongside its partnership with Petroci Holding. The progression to Baleine's phase 3, which is currently under evaluation, is expected to elevate total production to 150,000 barrels of oil per day and 200 million cubic feet of associated gas. The development will reinforce Côte d'Ivoire's strategic position as a regional energy hub and deepen Eni's collaborative ties with local partners.

Mani on Sunday called for a decisive solution to the issue.In a statement, Mr. Mani urged the authorities to either cull or translocate wild animals to address the escalating human-wildlife conflict. “Even during the day, people living on the forest fringes cannot move around or work without fear. The figures provided by the Forest department regarding wild animal population is inaccurate. The number of wild animals has grown exponentially, far exceeding the capacity of Kerala’s forests to sustain them,” he said.He proposed that the forest areas of Kerala should only accommodate a sustainable number of animals, with the surplus captured and relocated to other forest regions across India.

Images such as those are not just from “somewhere else.” The Altoona-based Central PA Humane Society can attest to that. The Humane Society’s exemplary work was a chief reason why it was selected as the beneficiary of this year’s Altoona Mirror Season of Sharing Campaign. On our TV screens this year also have been numerous pleas for financial assistance on behalf of ending the slaughter of elephants. It has been reported that each year at least 20,000 African elephants are killed illegally for their tusks to satisfy a resurgence in demand for elephant ivory, particularly in parts of Asia. There are fears elephants might someday be extinct. But not all of the concerns about extinction involve animals and other creatures whose habitat is confined to dry land. Oceans also are susceptible to extinctions, man-made or caused by natural forces or evolving conditions.

Beyoncé Declares 'Ivory Blonde' the Hair Color Trend of 2025 - NewBeauty,https://www.newbeauty.com/beyonce-ivory-blonde-hair/,2024-12-27,"If you celebrated Christmas, your day was hopefully filled with delicious food, festive drinks, quality time with loved ones—and Beyoncé. The music icon stole the show during her halftime performance at the Baltimore Ravens vs. Houston Texans game on December 25, and while every second had us glued to our screens, it’s her hair transformation that we’re still thinking about days later. The creative mastermind behind Beyoncé’s new “ivory blonde” hair color was celebrity colorist Rita Hazan. The pro shared a video of her client’s hair transformation straight from the NFL stage, on her Instagram grid. “Ivory blonde – when all the colors live in perfect harmony,” Hazan captioned the photo. “Wishing everyone a happy, healthy, and prosperous holiday and new year. ✨ The queen never disappoints! It’s always a pleasure to work with @beyonce, her work ethic and dedication is inspiring.” View this post on Instagram A post shared by Rita Hazan (@ritahazan) As seen in videos and imagery from the game (and etched into the minds of those lucky enough to watch live), Beyoncé’s hairstyle featured long, crimped waves which were parted in the center and delivered the perfect mix of texture and volume. As for the color, the multidimensional “ivory blonde” shade appeared to boast a blend of lighter platinum tones and soft, warm undertones for depth. At the time of writing, we’ve reached out to Hazan for the official definition of “ivory blonde,” so those inspired by the look can relay the exact details to their colorist.

Upon opening one of the boxes, they found a steel cage containing an Ethiopian lizard. The officials alerted the Wildlife Rescue Team, and when they arrived and inspected the other two boxes, they found a juvenile African corn snake and an adult Nigerian python. All three wildlife species were handed over to the Yelahanka Range Forest Officer (RFO) team, which later transferred them to the Bannerghatta Biological Park.A case has been taken up under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, and investigations are on to ascertain the source of the animals and the people involved in the racket. The box containing the rescued species did not have any address. It may be recalled that Kempegowda International Airport authorities recently busted two wildlife smuggling rackets. Last week, the Special Intelligence and Investigation Branch (SIIB) of Customs caught two people trying to smuggle four agile gibbons concealed in four suitcases. Due to the increased vigilance at the airport and sea ports in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, a senior official said the accused are using trains and roadways to smuggle the products. The officials suspect that the rescued reptiles may have been meant to be supplied to the pet shops in Bengaluru, who are selling them to their customers for their craze and demand for having these exotic species as pets.

However, being in an open relationship adds another level of complexity, ensuring that you give your partner proper attention, refrain from stoking their jealousy, and make them feel supported in your atypical arrangement.Danielle, who goes by @Openlycommitted on TikTok, explained how she and her husband, Rich, deal with one of the trickier aspects of being in an open relationship: how to text with the new person you are dating without being rude to your partner. For Danielle, it’s the same tech etiquette you should use in any other relationship.Danielle coaches couples who have open relationships or are considering one to develop a style that works for them.@openlycommittedI have had many people message me asking how to stop their partner from texting a lover, date or another partner in front of them… I think it’s basic texting etiquette to put a phone down when you are one-one-one with another person.

At the dinner table, everyone puts their phones down. And if I'm on a date with someone, whether that's a first date or a boyfriend or my husband or my son… or one-on-one time with a good friend or family member, my phone could distract me the entire time if I let it.

Cocoa Prices Sharply Lower on Strong Ivory Coast Cocoa Shipments - TradingView,https://www.tradingview.com/news/barchart:ab1e8a8ab094b:0-cocoa-prices-sharply-lower-on-strong-ivory-coast-cocoa-shipments/,2024-12-26,"March ICE NY cocoa (CCH25) Thursday closed down -825 (-6.96%), and March ICE London cocoa #7 (CAH25) did not trade with UK markets closed for the Boxing Day holiday. Cocoa prices Thursday plummeted to a 1-1/2 week low and closed sharply lower on news of continued high cocoa shipments by farmers in the Ivory Coast, the world's largest producer. Government data Monday showed that Ivory Coast farmers shipped 970,945 MT of cocoa to ports from October 1 to December 15, up +30% from 744,967 MT shipped the same time last year. Last Wednesday, NY Cocoa posted an all-time nearest-futures high, and London Cocoa posted an 8-month nearest-futures high on the deterioration of the West African cocoa mid-crop outlook. Maxar Technologies warned that dry conditions in West Africa will hurt the early development of the mid-year cocoa crop harvested in April and that the arrival of the seasonal Harmattan winds could worsen the situation. Shrinking global cocoa stockpiles are also bullish for prices. ICE-monitored cocoa inventories held in US ports have been trending lower for the past 1-1/2 years and fell to a 20-year low Monday of 1,380,383 bags. On the bullish side, Ghana last Friday reduced its 2024/25 (Sep-Aug) cocoa harvest forecast by -5% due to weather concerns, which was the second downward revision for the season. In a bullish factor, the International Cocoa Association (ICCO) on November 22 raised its 2023/24 global cocoa deficit estimate to -478,000 MT from May's -462,000 MT, the largest deficit in over 60 years. ICCO also cut its 2023/24 cocoa production estimate to 4.380 MMT from May's 4.461 MMT, down -13.1% y/y. ICCO projected a 2023/24 global cocoa stocks/grindings ratio of 27.0%, a 46-year low. Heavy rain in West Africa has led to reports of high mortality rates of cocoa buds on trees and pushed cocoa prices sharply higher. Heavy rain in the Ivory Coast has also flooded fields, increased disease risk, and affected crop quality. Recently harvested cocoa beans from the Ivory Coast signal lower quality, with counts of about 105 beans per 100 grams.

However, officials of the Bannerghatta National Park (BNP) claim that a recent audit of the godown revealed everything was intact, raising several questions. Officials of the CID Forest Cell’s mobile squad recently caught Nakulaiah, 30, a farmer in Krishnagiri district of Tamil Nadu, red-handed while trying to sell two tusks weighing 8.10 kilos. He had tied them in a plastic bag at the back of his motorcycle and was waiting for prospective clients when officials arrested him. Tusks marked ‘SC’ in red ink, suspect claims it was from BNPA senior CID Forest Cell official said that they were shocked to find ‘SC’ written on the tusks with red ink, leading them to suspect that it was seized by some government agency earlier, and the revelations made by the accused also matched the same suspicion. During his interrogation, he told officials that he had sourced the tusks from his elder brother Chinnaiah, who worked as a forest watcher at BNP for two months earlier this year on a contractual basis. Nakulaiah claimed that Chinnaiah brought two tusks when he quit his job and buried them in the backyard of their house, asking Nakulaiah to find prospective buyers and sell them with an assurance to s in the BNP store room for a few days for paperwork until it is handed over to Wildlife Forest Godown at Jalahalli. “During this transit, it is now suspected that insiders, including contract employees and forest watchers, steal the articles and hand them over to their network,” an official said. Meanwhile, in September this year, the investigation into two missing pieces of ivory from Arignar Anna Zoological Park in Vandalur, Chennai, revealed a racket of insiders selling seized ivory on the black market. Authorities suspect that nearly a tonne of ivory had gone missing from the zoo. The stolen ivory, similarly marked, is believed to be circulating among wildlife smugglers, with enforcement agencies recovering pieces of this consignment in multiple cases across the State in recent months.

Malindi Shipwreck Set to Pioneer Underwater Tourism in Kenya - Mwakilishi.com,https://www.mwakilishi.com/article/kenya-news/2024-12-24/malindi-shipwreck-set-to-pioneer-underwater-tourism-in-kenya,2025-07-26,"Live-in Nanny Wanted in Houston, Texas. Pay is Negotiable ‌‌ ‌‌ ‌‌ ‌‌ Malindi Shipwreck Set to Pioneer Underwater Tourism in Kenya A shipwreck discovered off the southern coast of Malindi, Kenya, has generated considerable interest as archaeologists investigate the possibility that it could be the galleon São Jorge, a vessel affiliated with the renowned navigator Vasco da Gama during his final African voyage. This undersea site, if confirmed, has the potential to emerge as an important tourist destination. The wreck, believed to date back over 500 years, was first identified in 2013 during an underwater exploration. Researchers from the National Museums of Kenya, led by Caesar Bita, are collaborating with experts from the University of Coimbra—Filipe Castro and José Pissarra—and Benedetto Frabetti from the Bergen Maritime Museum to conduct a thorough examination of the site. Their ongoing investigations focus on the submerged remains, which are thought to belong to a Portuguese ship that sank in the region. However, the excavation process has encountered multiple challenges, primarily due to the ship's location on a coral reef and the natural integration of the wreck with its surroundings over the centuries. Despite these difficulties, the research team has successfully recovered various artefacts, including elephant tusks and copper ingots, which support the hypothesis of the ship’s Portuguese provenance. Historically, the galleon São Jorge was reportedly part of Vasco da Gama’s fleet during his final expedition in 1524. This ship, constructed in 1513, played a vital role in 16th-century maritime operations, designed for both exploration and military engagements. Its construction and subsequent use by other European powers had a lasting impact on maritime navigation during that period. Recent archaeological efforts have included digging small trenches to unearth planks from the ship’s frame and hull, further reinforcing the team’s assertion regarding its identity. The study of the wreck remains ongoing, with plans to extend surveys along the coral reefs from Malindi to Ras Ngomeni, approximately 25 kilometres to the north. If the wreck is confirmed as the São Jorge, it would represent one of the earliest European shipwrecks identified in the Indian Ocean, offering invaluable insights into Vasco da Gama’s maritime expeditions in Kenyan waters. Such a finding could significantly enhance the region’s tourism and archaeological profile, potentially establishing the site as an underwater museum that educates the public about da Gama’s voyages and the historical context surrounding the galleon.

The facility, a long-pending demand from the Forest Department, is aimed at bringing to logical end the wildlife-related cases reported by the department, the forest cell of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) as well as the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;As per the Forest Department, an average of about 400 cases of wildlife crimes are registered every year in Karnataka. The cases range from selling of animals as pets, wildlife parts as pendants or medicine and other purposes. The conviction, however, has remained low.&lt;/p&gt;.Odisha sets up dedicated armed force unit for wildlife protection in Similipal Tiger Reserve.&lt;p&gt;Over the last two years, the department has been working to prepare the back-end infrastructure to operationalise the lab. Officials also collected reference DNA samples for many of the Schedule I and II wildlife in trade.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;&quot;Timely prosecution is a key element for an effective crackdown against wildlife offences. The DNA analysis plays a key role in determining a species and establishing evidence in the court. Till now, we have been dependent on external agencies and labs for getting DNA results. This may take from several weeks to months as the agencies will have their own priorities. The new facility at Madiwala will help us in getting results in a few days,&quot; Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife) Kumar Pushkar said.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;While cases of illegal possession, transportation or sale of elephant tusks, parts of tiger and leopard (skin, claw, etc.) are still detected, officials have observed that smaller mammals and reptiles account for a significant number of the cases. Last year, TRAFFIC and World Wildlife Fund reported that pangolin scales equating to 129 pangolins were seized in Karnataka during 2018-2022.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;The lab will also play a key role in resolving even in the cases of wildlife conflicts. In the case of samples collected from a conflict site, the lab will help establish whether the officials have capture-rescued the right animals.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;A senior official noted that the department needs to train its officers on handling samples for DNA analysis. For instance, after a woman was mauled by a leopard in Nelamangala taluk, the department rescued three leopards from the village but the DNA tests of the three leopards did not match with the sample collected from the site of the conflict. &quot;About 200 people had walked around in the area, possibly contaminating the original sample. The foresters need to be trained on cordoning off such sites and also sensitised against contamination while collecting samples,&quot; he noted.&lt;/p&gt;.&lt;p&gt;The Forest Department and the Police are expected to launch the lab within two months.&lt;/p&gt;",3306,True,0

Ivorians have previously viewed graffiti with disdain and graffiti artists were liable for prosecution. But that view is changing, and graffiti murals are increasingly common on city walls as the art form has gained acceptance. Towering murals and intricate graffiti pieces now adorn the exteriors of international hotels and major thoroughfares. The inaugural “Ivory Graff Graffiti Festival” attracted around 40 national and international artists who spent two weeks in November converting bland walls into 300-meter-long works of art. Benjamin Le Lieve, president of festival organizer Graff Ivoire, said he was proud to have launched a new initiative.

Pic story of intangible cultural heritage inheritor of ivory carving in Beijing - Xinhua,https://english.news.cn/20241223/f6bc8184329e46068d5bed73bf726b87/c.html,2024-12-23,"Pic story of intangible cultural heritage inheritor of ivory carving in Beijing 新华网 Editor: huaxia 2024-12-23 21:25:40 This photo taken on Dec. 17, 2024 shows a picture for designing ivory carving artwork displayed at the studio of Li Chunke in Beijing, capital of China. Ivory Carving, an ancient craft in China, was famous for its elegance due to its pure white material -- ivory. The earliest ivory carving artwork was found in a cultural relic in China during the Neolithic Age, dating back to 7,000 years ago. Beijing Ivory Carving, featuring elegant and luxuriant styles inherited from the imperial art, goes through several main procedures before completion such as designing, hewing, shoveling, face shaping and grinding.China has been intensifying its efforts in wildlife protection over the years. On Dec. 30, 2016, China declared that it would enforce a complete end of its domestic ivory trade within a year. Starting from Dec. 31 of 2017, processing or selling ivory and its products has been officially banned in China. Nowadays, carvers use mammoth tusks or antlers as substitutes.Li Chunke, born in 1949 in Beijing, a national-level intangible cultural heritage inheritor of ivory carving, started to learn the art since 15 years old. Over the sixty years of his career, Li has formed a uniquely simple and crisp style in his carving. He emphasizes on using the most simple lines and skills to express the theme of the artwork, also stressing on the traditional Chinese aesthetics. Many of his works have won important prizes in the art, with some be regarded as art treasures in China.In recent years, Li passes down the craft at Chinese National Academy of Arts, Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology and Beijing Light Industry Polytechnic College. He has cultivated over 20 students with master's degrees in arts and crafts and over 100 apprentices on ivory carving. He has also presided over the maintaining and repairing projects on 100 plus ancient ivory carving artworks at the Beijing Arts & Crafts Museum. For him, the art should lay importance to its subtle beauty inherited from the traditional Chinese culture. To further develop it, China needs",2175,True,0

How we worked to save wild animals all over the world in 2024,https://www.humanesociety.org/blog/saving-wild-animals-in-2024,,"One of the urgencies that defines our mission in this era is the rapidly increasing threat to wild animals all over the world. Under the overwhelming pressures of biodiversity loss, shrinking habitats and climate change, untold numbers of wild animals also face the cruelty of the illegal wildlife trade, trophy hunting, predator control and businesses that want to lock them in cages, pools, circus rings or petting zoos for entertainment. Others simply find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time, sparking human-wildlife conflict and its too-often fatal “solutions.” Where the threats are many, dexterity is essential. We are proud that our work to end cruelties that afflict wildlife involves a multitude of strategies designed to ensure their protection. Here are just some of the pro-wildlife practices and policies we pursued in 2024: Protecting wild animals from cruelty We take action to stop cruelty from finding animals in their wild homes, whether it’s the manifest harms of the wildlife trade or the scope of a trophy hunter’s rifle. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced a rule that will effectively ban elephant hunting trophy imports from certain countries that serve as major destinations for trophy hunters—a win for the conservation of the species listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. We released an undercover investigation that exposed a thriving market for elephant ivory in Connecticut, showing that the weak patchwork of laws addressing the elephant ivory trade is not enough. We and our allies won an injunction in federal court halting wolf trapping in Idaho’s grizzly bear habitat, an area covering roughly half of the state. The court’s ruling cited the unacceptable risk that indiscriminate steel-jawed leghold traps and snares pose to grizzlies. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service finalized a rule under the Endangered Species Act to support reintroduction and recovery of grizzly bears within the North Cascades Ecosystem. The U.S. National Park Service finalized a rule to ban the use of donuts, dog food, meat scraps and other smelly bait to attract brown bears and black bears to be hunted and killed on Alaska’s national preserves. We successfully shielded cougars from additional trophy hunting in Washington, where the state’s wildlife commission adopted rules based on a petition we submitted with coalition partners. In Texas, we supported a successful effort to ban the canned hunting of cougars and establish a trap-check time to spare animals caught in traps from prolonged suffering before their deaths at the hands of trappers. With allies, we successfully defeated a proposal by the South Dakota Game Fish and Parks Commission to reduce the population of mountain lions. We sent an expert delegation to the International Whaling Commission conference in Peru to advocate for better protections for cetaceans and an end to commercial whaling. In Iceland, we worked alongside our partner groups to amplify calls for a ban on commercial whaling there including submitting a 2.2 million signature petition with Avaaz. We collaborated with Costa Rica’s National Environmental Security Commission to train , such as an ABC News feature. Wild animals kept captive on fur farms so that they can be brutally killed suffer tremendously, which is why we also fight the fur trade all over the world— about 2024 wins in this work. Preventing conflict and improving coexistence Too often, responses meant to address human-wildlife conflict result in significant harm to animals. In 2024, we advanced and implemented humane and effective approaches to conflict resolution that promote coexistence. This year, animal care and control professionals across the U.S. took",3731,True,0

It could become Kenya's first-ever underwater museum. [Jayne Rose Gacheri] A shipwreck found off the southern coast of Malindi might become a valuable tourist attraction if archaeologists’ ongoing research confirms that it is the one the great voyager Vasco da Gama used in his last voyage to Africa. The wreck found near the southernmost part of the Kenyan coast is the remnants of the galleon São Jorge—a Portuguese ship believed to have sunk during famed explorer Vasco da Gama’s final voyage. Caesar Bita (National Museum of Kenya) in partnership with F Castro, J Pissarra (University of Coimbra), and B Frabetti (Bergen Maritime Museum), are conducting the research. The four archaeologists say they believe the shipwreck found in 2013 at the southern part of Kenya’s coast might be the relics of the majestic galleon Sao Jorge that sunk during the famed explorer Vasco Da Gama’s final voyage in 1524. According to their report , and it came to rest on a coral reef,” the archaeologists write in the journal. Over the years the ship has settled into the reef, making studying a difficult proposition. However, over the past decade, several artifacts have been retrieved from the wreck, such as elephant tusks and copper ingots, which pointed to the ship as being early Portuguese.",1540,True,0

It took about a minute, but finally a child of about six years old emerged from the crowd sitting on the south bleachers and brought her ticket to the table. She was then ushered toward a row of bicycles where she picked out a glossy new 16-inch with pink trim and rolled it toward the gym entrance. She also got her choice from three rows of games, toys and clothing items. This process would be repeated a few dozen times until all the gifts that fundraisers and donors had helped gather for this day were gone. Parents and children began arriving to the gym at about 11:00 a.m., where they were served nachos, hot dogs, pizza and a beverage in the lobby of the gym. They could also pick out a free winter hat in designs incorporating striking multi-colors. In the gym itself, many folk ate their meals while sitting on the south side bleachers as a variety of Christmas-themed R&B tunes played on large speakers. After an hour or so, Curry and several of his assistants, including his fellow Prescott City Council member Patricia Roberts, began the day's giveaway. After leading a prayer, Curry spoke of those who had helped him make such a day possible. ""We want to thank the community. We got together, and we work together to make all this happen for you. And I have to, I have to give brother Frank Henson a shout out. He really supports what we do, and he supported it in a very big way. He was supposed to be here, but he had a funeral. He's really done a wonderful job working with us, not just for this event, but for every event,"" Curry said. Henson is the pastor of Prescott's First Baptist Church. ""Here's the deal. We're going to start out this year with two gifts. So when the child has a ticket called, you have a number, you get two gifts, not two bicycles, okay, a smaller gift. But we're glad to be able to do this. We thank God for the blessing. Now we'll start,"" Curry said. And that's when he began reading numbers. About fifty bicycles, tricycles and Halo scooters would be given away and several dozen toys. To watch reminded you of many of the best past Christmases and renewed hope for many such Christmases to come.

While investigations revealed that the tusks were allegedly stolen from the secure repository at Bannerghatta National Park by a temporary forest watcher employed there, officials have denied these claims, stating that all confiscated wildlife articles remain intact. The arrested man, identified as Nakul (30), a resident of Krishnagar district in Tamil Nadu, confessed during interrogation that he had received the tusks from his elder brother, Chinnayya.

Current sign goalkeeper Laurel Ivory - KC Soccer Journal,https://kcsoccerjournal.com/12/20/2024/current-sign-goalkeeper-laurel-ivory/,2024-12-20,"Laurel Ivory | Credit: Thad Bell KC Soccer Journal Kansas City Current fans gained some clarity on the goalkeeper position for the 2025 season this week. First the Current posted the obligatory thank you and good luck in the future posts on social media to Almuth Schult and AD Franch . The Current had already revealed they were out of contract but it was implied they might both be back. Now it is evident AD and Almuth will not be back in a Current uniform. Next in quick order, a keeper rumor popped up, and then an actual announcement. The Current signed free agent goalkeeper Laurel Ivory to a one-year contract through the 2025 season, with a mutual option for 2026. Ivory is a former US Youth National Team goalkeeper who joined the Seattle Reign in 2022 after college. Ivory went to the University of Virginia. “Laurel is a great young goalkeeper who can strengthen a position that is critical for us” said sporting director and head coach Vlatko Andonovski via press release. “We’ve seen firsthand how good she can play and we are happy to have her come to Kansas City.” Ivory made her professional debut in 2023 during the NWSL Challenge Cup. Last season, Ivory made eight starts in nine appearances for Seattle. The Current had a good look at her in May when she was able to earn a shutout versus the Current. It was the first time Kansas City was scoreless in the 2024 season. She was not so fortunate when the Reign visited Kansas City and the Current ran roughshod over Seattle in a 5-2 win. A second keeper close? Around the same time the Current announced Ivory, a report linked Brazilian National Team keeper Lorena to the Current. Lorena was one of the stars of the 2024 Olympics, impressing with her tremendous saves. She helped lead Brazil to the Gold Medal match against the US Womens National Team. Lorena and Brazil only allowed one goal but fell 1-0 to the USWNT. With Almuth Schult setting a benchmark for quality play in goal, it was expected the Current would go for a high-level keeper to replace her. Lorena would seem to fit that expectation for Kansas City. This report is",2104,True,0

Upon receiving the information, we immediately inspected the forest, and everything was found to be intact, with nothing missing. If we receive any credible information, we will certainly investigate further. However, no such incident has occurred. The very next day, everything was thoroughly checked, and all items were in their rightful place. This seems to have been done with an intention to malign and spread false narratives,” said an official.Recovered tusks raise concernsThe recovered tusks, identified as belonging to an Asiatic elephant (Elephas maximus), are significant in size and weight. One tusk measured over four feet and weighed 8.1 kilograms, while the other was 3.9 feet long and weighed 7.6 kilograms. Their distinct size and official markings add to their value, making them highly sought after in the illegal wildlife trade.This case has highlighted serious gaps in safeguarding confiscated wildlife articles, prompting renewed calls for stricter oversight and better security protocols. In response, forest officials conducted a thorough inspection of the park’s repository and confirmed that their inventory remains intact.Family missingMeanwhile, Chinnayya, the key accused, remains on the run. Authorities confirmed that his family has also gone missing, with no information about their whereabouts. Law enforcement agencies are intensifying efforts to locate Chinnayya and his family as investigations continue.",2868,True,0

Parliament approves extension of UK's Ivory Act - Born Free Foundation,https://www.bornfree.org.uk/news/parliament-approves-extension-of-uks-ivory-act/,2024-12-19,"Born Free celebrates the addition inclusion of additional ivory-bearing species including hippos, narwhals, sperm whales and killer whales to the Act. On 16th December, the House of Commons approved the Ivory Act 2018 (Meaning of “Ivory” and Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2024, which extend the domestic restrictions on elephant ivory trade to hippo, narwhal, sperm whale and killer whale ivory and ivory products. International trade in elephant ivory was effectively banned by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in 1989; however, the poaching of elephants across Africa has continued in order to supply legal and illegal domestic markets around the world, with devastating ongoing impacts on individual elephants and their populations. Over recent years, an increasing number of countries have introduced restrictions on domestic elephant ivory trade, including key markets in China and the United States. The UK’s Ivory Act, which passed into law in 2018 and came into effect in June 2022, introduced some of the world’s strongest national restrictions on elephant ivory trade, with limited exemptions for certain items containing ivory. The UK was previously a major exporter of antique elephant ivory as well as allowing domestic trading, playing a role in the consumer demand for ivory products. However, ivory isn’t just derived from elephants. The teeth and tusks from hippos, walruses, warthogs, and several toothed whale species, are also coveted and traded. The new regulations cover some of these species; trade in walrus ivory is al INFO: IVORY TRADE",1628,True,0

(A representational image. photo credit: Getty images) Trichy: In a shocking turn of events, an Assistant Inspector of Police from the Armed Police Force of Trichy has been arrested for his involvement in the sale of toys made from elephant tusks. The arrest was made by Villupuram forest department officials, who received information about a gang smuggling elephant tusk toys into Villupuram town. Four elephant ivory toys weighing 6½ kg and a necklace, along with a car and three two-wheelers used for smuggling, were seized from the arrested individuals. These toys are estimated to be around 50 years old and are valued at several lakhs. The Tusk Trader: Police Sub-Inspector’s Shocking Involvement in Elephant Tusk Toy Smuggling On the 13th of last month, forest officials received a tip-off about the smuggling and quickly swung into action, arresting 12 people, including Viswanathan’s wife Eeswari (50), Karuppusamy (24), Mohammad Ziauddin (50) from Papanasam Devarajanpettai in Thanjavur district, Justice (46) from Aranthangi L.R.

He was subsequently arrested and produced before the Villupuram Magistrate’s Court, where he was sent to jail. The arrest of a police sub-inspector from Trichy in the sale of toys made of elephant tusks has created a stir. The forest department has decided to investigate how Manivannan’s relative acquired the elephant toys and plans to make further arrests.

With a life that was dictated by circus tricks and brutal training, today the male tusker celebrates 14 years of his freedom at Wildlife SOS’ elephant sanctuary in Mathura, where he enjoys a safer life. Compelled to perform at a circus, audiences would be overjoyed to watch captive elephant Rajesh stand on his hind legs and play football, unaware of the brutal training that he had to endure to perform all these unnatural tricks. He would spend hours being tortured, beaten with sticks and bull-hooks to “obey” commands. The abuse he faced as a performing elephant caused severe mental distress. Despite being freed from this painful life when Wildlife SOS successfully rescued and rehabilitated him, Rajesh initially displayed stereotypic behaviour. He refused to rest and constantly trumpeted in discomfort when the veterinary team would approach him for treatment. Gradually, the vets used soothing songs to calm him down and he started trusting his caregivers. The veterinary team treated the wounds on his feet and provided a nutritious diet to revive his strength.

Ivory Coast's humanitarian commitment: balancing challenges with hope - Focus On Africa -,https://www.focusonafrica.info/en/costa-davorio-limpegno-umanitario-del-paese-tra-sfide-e-speranza/,2024-12-15,"ITA ENG Sviluppo Costa d’Avorio, l’impegno umanitario del paese tra sfide e speranza Guido Gargiulo – Dicembre 15, 2024 Gli investimenti nel nord non si sono concentrati solo sul miglioramento delle infrastrutture, ma anche sul rafforzamento dei legami tra le comunità e le forze di sicurezza La Costa d’Avorio, un paese che spesso è stato menzionato per la sua resilienza e visione progressista, continua a navigare tra le complessità dell’accoglienza di decine di migliaia di richiedenti asilo in fuga dall’instabilità della regione del Sahel. Questa crisi, alimentata dalla violenza terroristica nei paesi vicini come Burkina Faso e Mali, ha messo a dura prova le regioni settentrionali della Costa d’Avorio. Eppure, il paese è emerso come un faro di speranza, dimostrando come l’impegno verso i principi umanitari possa coesistere con gli sforzi per rafforzare la sicurezza nazionale e promuovere lo sviluppo. Negli ultimi anni, la Costa d’Avorio ha accolto oltre 63.000 richiedenti asilo, una cifra che sottolinea l’entità della crisi regionale. Nonostante risorse limitate e le pressioni legate ai propri bisogni di sviluppo, il governo ivoriano ha lavorato con impegno per integrare le popolazioni sfollate. Gli investimenti nel nord non si sono concentrati solo sul miglioramento delle infrastrutture, ma anche sul rafforzamento dei legami tra le comunità e le forze di sicurezza. Questo approccio, che unisce con sé sviluppo e misure di sicurezza, ha ricevuto riconoscimenti internazionali, con l’elogio del Relatore Speciale delle Nazioni Unite, Ben Saul. Annunci L’approccio proattivo del governo si riflette soprattutto in iniziative come la “Strategia nazionale per la lotta al terrorismo”. Questo piano globale mira a affrontare le cause profonde dell’instabilità, promuovendo inclusività e trasparenza. Sebbene permangano importanti sfide, come la grande povertà, i servizi pubblici limitati e la competizione per le risorse naturali, l’impegno della Costa d’Avorio volto a mitigare la violenza transfrontaliera è stato riconosciuto come un passo cruciale verso la stabilità regionale. Oltre alla gestione della crisi dei rifugiati, la Costa d’Avorio ha compiuto progressi significativi nel rimpatrio e nella reintegrazione dei propri cittadini sfollati a causa di conflitti passati. Dal 2011, oltre 280.000 rifugiati ivoriani sono tornati a casa, merito anche di iniziative diplomatiche con la Liberia e il supporto finanziario per la reintegrazione fornito dall’UNHCR. Questi sforzi hanno aiutato a ricostruire vite e rafforzare le comunità, consolidando la reputazione del paese come leader nella ripresa post-crisi. Tuttavia, la strada da percorrere è ancora piena di ostacoli. La visita di Saul ha evidenziato aree da migliorare, come la necessità di perfezionare il quadro legale per il contrasto al terrorismo, in modo da allinearsi agli standard internazionali, e di affrontare al meglio le condizioni all’interno delle prigioni nazionali. La tutela delle libertà civili e dei diritti della società civile rimane fondamentale per garantire che le misure di sicurezza non compromettano i principi democratici. L’impegno della Costa d’Avorio per porre fine all’apolidia è un ulteriore esempio del suo ethos umanitario. Prioritizzando l’inclusione sociale e la cooperazione regionale, il paese ha stabilito un modello per gestire crisi umanitarie complesse nel rispetto della dignità umana. La capacità del governo ivoriano di bilanciare bisogni immediati con soluzioni a lungo termine riflette la sua resilienza e visione. Man mano che la nazione continua a evolversi, i suoi sforzi servono come un potente promemoria di ciò che può essere raggiunto quando valori come compassione e pragmatismo si mescolano insieme e danno i loro frutti.

This crisis, driven by terrorist violence in neighboring countries such as Burkina Faso and Mali, has placed immense strain on the northern regions of Côte d’Ivoire. Yet, the country has emerged as a beacon of hope, demonstrating how commitment to humanitarian principles can coexist with efforts to bolster national security and foster development. In recent years, Côte d’Ivoire has welcomed over 63,000 asylum seekers, a figure that underscores the magnitude of the regional crisis. Despite limited resources and the pressures of its own developmental needs, the Ivorian government has worked diligently to integrate these displaced populations. Investments in the north have aimed not only at improving infrastructure but also at strengthening the bonds between communities and security forces.

There were no signs of starvation, infections, or naturally occurring anthrax, and the giant mammals' tusks were still intact, ruling out poaching. Some of the elephants were found face down, suggesting a sudden collapse.That left one prime suspect, toxic cyanobacteria – also known as blue-green algae – which now, four years later, a new study led by King's College London supports.Geographer Davide Lomeo and colleagues' analysis of satellite data reveals toxic algal blooms had exploded in water sources near the Okavango Delta during the same time period, all but certainly poisoning the African bush elephants (Loxodonta africana).Elephants in the Okavango Delta in Botswana.

Endeavour Mining says study shows potential of new Ivory Coast mine | AJ Bell,https://www.youinvest.co.uk/articles/latestnews/283499/endeavour-mining-says-study-shows-potential-new-ivory-coast-mine,,"Please note that tax, investment, pension and ISA rules can change and the information and any views contained in this article may now be inaccurate. Endeavour Mining PLC on Wednesday said a pre-feasibility study at an Ivory Coast project confirms its potential to become a tier one asset for the company. London-based Endeavour is a West Africa-focused gold producer with mines in Senegal, Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso. Endeavour said the study showed its Assafou-Dibibango project could produce 329,000 ounces of gold per year, at all-in sustaining costs of $892 per ounce, for its first ten years. The company said the initial capital for the mine is $734 million with a 15-year life based on a maiden reserve of 4.1 million ounces. Endeavour said the project shows robust economics with a post-tax net present value of around $1.53 billion, and a 28% internal rate of return at a $2,000 per ounce gold price. The firm will now start a definitive feasibility study, which it expects to finish between late 2025 and early 2026. This will also involve investigation of satellite deposits close to the Assafou site, and further resource expansion and definition. Chief Executive Officer Ian Cockerill said: ‘We have defined a large, low-cost and long mine life project, capable of producing [330,000 ounces] a year over the first ten years, while remaining firmly in the lowest cost quartile. ‘The attractive returns profile ensures this project will remain a capital allocation priority for us and it demonstrates our ability to generate highly value accretive projects, organically, through our pipeline.’ The company said it will simultaneously move forward with the permitting process so that construction could potentially launch in the second half of 2026. Shares in Endeavour Mining were up 1.8% at 1,527.00 pence in London on Wednesday morning. Copyright 2024 Alliance News Ltd. All Rights Reserved.

Two musical titans engage in frivolous shenanigans while ostensibly preparing to write a song. This concept serves as a platform for commentary, mocking the superficialities of celebrity culture.“Ebony and Ivory,” which premiered at Fantastic Fest, has sparked interest for its acceptance of the ludicrous while dissecting the cultural moment it reflects. The 1982 original song has garnered both praise and scorn.

Elephant's electrocution death raises concerns - The Island,http://island.lk/elephants-electrocution-death-raises-concerns/,2024-12-08,"Deega Danthu 1 was found dead in the Kalawewa National Park (UCAN Photo) Share  (UCAN)The tragic death of one of Sri Lanka’s largest tusker elephants reportedly due to electrocution has raised concern and suspicion among environmentalists in the island nation. Deega Danthu 1 was found dead last week after being fatally entangled in an illegal electric fence at the Kalawewa National Park, a wildlife warden said. Police are investigating and looking to identify and arrest the person responsible for setting up the unauthorized electric line. “We suspect the elephant was killed for its tusks,” environmentalist Nayanaka Ranwella said at a press conference on Dec. 1. He said elephants have been found dead “for the same reason in the past but despite repeated complaints, authorities have remained silent.” Deega Danthu 1 was a key attraction for tourists. Known for its long tusks and gentle nature, the 45 to 50-year-old tusker had been relocated to the national park due to flooding from the Kala Wewa reservoir. Buddhist monks conducted the funeral rites for Deega Danthu 1 as members of the local community expressed their sorrow by offering alms and participating in the rituals. Ranwella expressed concern over the safety of elephants despite them being revered across Buddhist and Hindu temples in the nation. Elephants are tamed and paraded during important festivals including an annual procession to honor the sacred tooth relic of Buddha in Kandy during July and August. Surin Mallawadeniya, another environmentalist, said the authorities had failed to find a sustainable solution to protect elephants. “The wild elephant population will one day be wiped out from our country due to increasing human-animal conflicts,” he told UCA  Implementation letter on Debt Restructuring between the Government of the French Republic and the Government of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka in relation to External Debt Restructuring Process signed Latest  Cambodians flee border with Thailand as clashes continue for third day Foreign  Ten killed, 12 injured in Vietnam sleeper bus road crash Latest  Tim David smashes fastest T20I century for Australia to make it 3-0 Latest  Record-breaking Root arms England with control of Manchester Test  Ambassadors of Bhutan, Kazakhstan, Jordan, Uzbekistan, and Eritrea meet PM  ‘Dates have the highest sugar content to fight Coronavirus’  Sunday Island 27 December – Headlines  #SundayIsland 17th December – Headlines  Sunday Island – 28th March  Sunday Island Headlines – 21 March  Sunday Island – 21st February – Headlines Trending Sports5 days ago Tharanga vows overhaul as Sri Lanka seek T-20 revival ahead of World Cup Opinion5 days ago ‘Muslims in the Dock’:A clarion call against Islamophobia Features6 days ago The doctor’s dilemma Features7 days ago Ceylon’s path to setting up a university : Public Lecture Series 1918-1921  Man who tried to smuggle in gold worth Rs. 1.1 bn gets bail Editorial6 days ago Saving tanks: Rhetoric and reality  Education Reforms: Govt. forges ahead amidst widespread protests Business5 days ago A ‘timely and courageous book’ that is also ‘a call to conscience’",3159,True,0

"Attiéké - Ivory Coast's timeless culinary treasure, which now has Unesco status - BBC",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2pd2854lxo,2024-12-07,"One of my earliest childhood memories is hearing vendors sing ""Attiéké chaud! Attiéké chaud!"" or ""Hot attiéké!"" as they strolled the streets of my neighbourhood, balancing large baskets of this national delicacy on their heads. Fast-forward 25 years and women carrying individually wrapped portions of the fermented cassava couscous still walk across Abidjan, Ivory Coast's biggest city, selling this now Unesco-recognised dish. An alternative to rice, it's hard to find any hospitality venue in the Ivory Coast that doesn't serve attiéké. From the most basic eateries to the fanciest restaurants and even on the beach, it's everywhere. Attiéké's popularity has spilled over the country's borders, and it is now found across Africa, especially in French-speaking countries. It's also very popular in neighbouring Ghana and my home country Sierra Leone, where they have some fairly unorthodox serving suggestions. The distinctive tangy taste of attiéké comes from the cassava tubers mixed with fermented cassava, which gives it its unique flavour and texture. The cassava is grated, dried and then steamed before serving. Filling and versatile, Ivorian chef Rōze Traore describes its texture as ""fluffy yet granular, similar to couscous"". Mr Traore adds that the slight tanginess of attiéké provides a unique depth to meals, perfectly balancing spicy or savoury sauces. For Paule-Odile Béké, an Ivorian chef who competed on the UK TV programme Masterchef: The Professionals, ""sour, zingy and sweet"" are the words that come to mind when she describes the taste of attiéké. Gluten-free and available in different grain sizes, the finest is often the most expensive. Some places even sell red attiéké, which has been soaked in palm oil. Eaten with a variety of dishes, the most popular version is with chargrilled chicken or fish, a simple, spicy tomato-based sauce and a salsa of chopped tomatoes and onions. It was one of the first dishes I cooked for my husband when we met 15 years ago. He",1989,True,0

James Ivory on his career with Ismail Merchant: There are a lot of films we made that people ...,https://www.bfi.org.uk/interviews/james-ivory-merchant-ivory,2024-12-06,"Despite its name, Stephen Soucy’s new documentary Merchant Ivory focuses not just on the hugely successful partnership (personal, as well as professional) between producer Ismail Merchant and director James Ivory, best known for their period dramas and literary adaptations, such as A Room with a View (1985), Howards End (1992) and The Remains of the Day (1993). Soucy also explores the creatives who were key to their success, including regular collaborators screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala and composer Richard Robbins, as well as dozens of actors, editors and costumer designers who talk about the unique magic of the prolific production company. It’s a lively, often gossipy documentary that offers new insights into the remarkable partnership, as well as doing full justice to the extensive Merchant Ivory filmography, which stretches far beyond the period dramas of the late 1980s and early 1990s for which they are best known. It divides their filmography into fairly distinct eras, starting with the many films they made in India in the 1960s, before moving to the 70s and 80s when they were making films all around the world,",1137,True,0

The organisations are requesting, on behalf of the victims, that the Court declare the 6 August 2018 amnesty unlawful under International Law. Since 2013, FIDH, MIDH, and LIDHO have stood by the victims and will remain steadfast in their fight to ensure justice is served in Ivory Coast. Abidjan, Paris, 5 December 2024. In Ivory Coast, for those whose lives were shattered by the crimes committed after the 2010 presidential election, President Alassane Ouattara’s amnesty law represents an intolerable denial of justice. Although presented as a means to heal a divided society, the lack of prosecutions only perpetuates the violence and suffering of the victims. For them, judicial truth is irreplaceable. ""This amnesty has destroyed the hopes of justice for the victims of the post-electoral crisis, who placed their trust in the national justice system by joining as civil parties"", says Drissa Traoré, lawyer and Secretary General of FIDH. ""We urge the ECOWAS Court of Justice to declare these measures incompatible with regional and International Law, as well as with Ivory Coast’s commitments to human rights."" International law obligates states to prosecute those responsible for grave crimes, such as crimes against humanity and war crimes, to ensure that victims’ rights to truth, justice and reparations are upheld. The key regional and international treaties to which Ivory Coast is a party —including the Convention Against Torture, the Geneva Conventions, and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court— mandate the prosecution of individuals suspected of committing such serious crimes. ""The appeal for abuse of power that our organisations submitted to the Council of State was dismissed. The cycle of impunity persists, leaving the victims without any possible recourse at the national level"", says Willy Neth, President of LIDHO. ""The reconciliation imposed by the Ivorian authorities has been achieved at the expense of the victims and their fundamental right to truth, justice, and reparation"", adds Drissa Bamba, President of MIDH. The organisations’ request filed today, argues that the amnesty measure also violates the principles enshrined in the Constitutive Act of the African Union and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights.",2692,True,0

According to Vengatesh Prabhu, Divisional Forest Officer (Gudalur), 4 ADS members and a forest watcher were monitoring the animal and were trying to divert it from human habitations when it suddenly turned against the staff and rushed towards the vehicle.The animal used its tusks to damage one of the windows and then overturned the vehicle before fleeing to the forest. Local residents rushed to the aid of the forest staff and helped them out of the vehicle. One ADS member suffered a shoulder injury and was taken to Wayanad in Kerala for further treatment, officials stated. This is the third attack on a forest vehicle by an elephant in the Gudalur division in recent months. Mr. Prabhu, the DFO, said that while this attack was by an elephant known as Pandalur Tusker-12 (PT12), the previous two incidents were caused by another elephant in Cherambadi, known as Cherambadi Tusker-16 (CT16). He said that rumours that all three attacks were by the same elephant were false, and urged people not to sp aggressive behaviour. “Our field staff are the last line separating elephants and people, and are working day and night to ensure that both sides are kept safe.

Archaeologists Find Shipwreck From Vasco Da Gama's Final Voyage Into The Indian Ocean,https://www.marineinsight.com/shipping-news/archaeologists-find-shipwreck-from-vasco-da-gamas-final-voyage-into-the-indian-ocean/,2024-12-05,"Skip to content Image for representation purposes only In a remarkable discovery, researchers might have found the vessel that took the famous Portuguese explorer on his last voyage into the Indian Ocean. The shipwreck lies close to Malindi in Kenya and has attracted the attention of many archaeologists. Although the ship was found in 2013, on a coral reef around 500 m off the coast of Kenya, it sank 500 years ago and could be Vasco da Gama’s ship, Sao Jorge. Scholars from the University of Coimbra, the National Museum of Kenya and the Bergen Maritime Museum are working to ascertain the ship’s identity. The shipwreck has yielded many artefacts and the findings were published in the Journal of Maritime Archaeology. Prominent artefacts found in the wreck include elephant tusks and copper ingots and timbers from its hull. Vasco da Gama took a pioneering route from Europe into the Indian Ocean and was the first person to find a sea route which linked Europe and Africa. He was also the first to sail around the Cape of Good Hope on the southernmost tip of Africa which led to the beginning of Portuguese trade in the Indian Ocean. Throughout his life, Vasco da Gama took four journeys in the Indian Ocean, the last in 1524 which had an armada of 20 vessels, including Sao Jorge. The Sao Jorge sank later in 1524 before the death of Da Gama. Per researchers, it is one of the earliest shipwrecks in the Indian Ocean. The researchers stated that the provisional dates of the artefacts point to the ship on a journey to India. To confirm if this is really Da Gama’s ship, the archaeologists will perform surveys of the coral reefs nearby stretching 25 km from Malindi to Ras Ngomeni Cape. There are many Portuguese shipwrecks in and around Malindi. In the 1500s, the Portuguese began constructing galleons which could be used in war and exploration of the Oceans. They have 3 or 4 masts and could be equipped with artillery. The design was copied from Europe and changed the course of European Expansion.

The horrific act, believed to have been carried out for superstitious purposes, has left conservationists and local residents outraged. The tragedy came to light on Tuesday morning when the lifeless elephant was discovered in a paddy field. Initially, forest officials suspected electrocution from a live wire as the cause of death. However, the absence of key body parts raised concerns about a planned act of poaching. An investigation led by the Forest Department and local police uncovered blood traces in a nearby village, leading to the arrest of a man identified as Fridison. The accused reportedly confessed to killing the elephant and removing its body parts for rituals aimed at obtaining supernatural powers. The severed trunk, tusks, and tail were recovered from his possession. Officials described the act as both barbaric and deeply rooted in dangerous superstitions. ""This kind of cruelty underscores the urgency of addressing illegal wildlife killings and superstition-driven practices,"" said a senior forest officer involved in the case. The incident has sparked widespread condemnation, with environmentalists calling for stricter laws and awareness campaigns to curb such practices. While the accused remains in custody, authorities are investigating whether he acted alone or as part of a larger network.

The report highlights that despite the ongoing efforts of multiple security agencies, smuggling of different items remains uncontrolled. The report also sheds light on the alarming connection between international lottery scams and drug trafficking, pointing out that these scams often target vulnerable individuals. It describes how these frauds prey on people’s financial struggles or isolation, luring them with false promises of large prizes while hiding their true criminal intentions.It stresses that as a member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), India places high importance on combating such illegal activities. In the year 2023-24, the DRI successfully seized goods in violation of the SCOMET and WMD Acts, as well as foreign currency worth INR 12.38 crore across 25 cases nationwide. In 2023-24, the DRI registered 109 cases involving a total of 8,223.61 kg of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.

Initially discovered in 2013, researchers believe the wreck off the coast of Kenya is da Gama’s 16th-century Sao Jorge. The Portuguese explorer took a pioneering route from Europe into the Indian Ocean. He was the first person to link Europe and Africa via the ocean and the first to sail around the Cape of Good Hope, the southernmost tip of Africa. This was the starting point for Portuguese trade in the Indian Ocean. Da Gama made four journeys to the Indian Ocean throughout his life. The last, in 1524, featured an armada of 20 ships, including the Sao Jorge. Photo: Filipe Castro Just six meters deep The Sao Jorge sank later that year, shortly before da Gama died. If the researchers are correct, then this is one of the earliest European shipwrecks in the Indian Ocean. When originally discovered in 2013 just six meters below the surface, divers found copper ingots and elephant tusks around the submerged ship, as well as timbers from its hull. “The provisional dates of the artifacts point to a shipwreck on the outward journey to India and a shipwreck date in the first quarter of the sixteenth century,” the researchers said in a statement. To confirm that it is da Gama’s ship, the team will now carry out archaeological surveys of the nearby coral reefs. These stretch 25 kilometers from the beach resort town of Malindi, where the wreckage lies, to a cape called Ras Ngomeni. Filipe Castro, a nautical archaeologist leading the study, admits that they still aren’t sure if the wreckage belongs to the Sao Jorge, but if so, “it is a treasure.” Photo: Filipe Castro There are several Portuguese shipwrecks from the same time period around Malindi. In the early 1500s Portugal started creating galleons — ships that could be used both in war and for exploration of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Each had three or four masts and could be fitted with artillery in several places. The design was copied across Europe and “changed the history of European expansion,” said Castro.",2194,True,0

Ghana's Asante kingdom: Celebrating the king banished by the British to Seychelles - BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgxj343elmo,2024-11-27,"The field outside the royal palace in the Ghanaian city of Kumasi was filled with an exuberant crowd, celebrating the return 100 years ago of an exiled king. Prempeh was the Asante king, or ""Asantehene"", of the late 19th Century who resisted British demands that his territory be swallowed up into the expanding Gold Coast protectorate. A British army from the coast marched about 200km (124 miles) to Kumasi in 1896, and took Prempeh as well as about 50 relatives, chiefs and servants as prisoners, and then looted his palace. The prisoners were taken to the coastal fort at Elmina, before being shipped to Sierra Leone, and, in 1900, on to the distant Indian Ocean islands of Seychelles. It was not until 1924 that the British allowed Prempeh to return home, by which time he was an elderly man who arrived in Kumasi wearing a European suit and hat. It is a tragic story, but also one of pride and resistance. ""The British did all they could but they couldn’t break the spirit of Asante,"" shouted the master of ceremonies. The current Asantehene, Osei Tutu II, was paraded on his palanquin through the crowd, weighed down by magnificent gold jewellery, amid a glorious cacophony of musket explosions, drum beats and the blare of horns made from elephant tusks. Asante culture is alive and well. But Prempeh’s exile did have a lasting impact on both the Asante kingdom and Seychelles, although perhaps not in ways intended by British officials at the time. The guest of honour at the centenary celebrations, held in Kumasi at the weekend, was Seychelles' President Wavel Ramkalawan, who said ""it was an honour, though sad, for us to receive your great king"". ""He showed respect to our people, and in return received the full love of the Seychelles,"" Ramkalawan added. The proof of that is in family ties cherished to this day. Princess Mary Prempeh Marimba is Prempeh’s great-grand-daughter. Her grandfather, James, the son of Prempeh, married a Seychellois woman, and initially stayed on the islands after his father left. Mary is a nursing supervisor in Seychelles' capital, Victoria, and travelled to Kumasi with her daughter Suzy, to re-unite with dozens of long-lost relatives and discover",2195,True,0

Last Friday, NY cocoa posted a 2-1/2 month high, and London cocoa posted a 4-1/4 month high. The impact of recent heavy rains on the Ivory Coast pushed cocoa prices sharply higher, based on reports of high mortality rates of cocoa buds on trees because of the heavy rain.Recent adverse weather in West Africa has pushed cocoa prices higher.

The vessel sunk in Kenya in the 500s resurfaces - MalindiKenya.net,https://www.malindikenya.net/en/articles/news/last-news/the-vessel-sunk-in-kenya-in-the-500s-resurfaces.html,,"ARCHEOLOGY The vessel sunk in Kenya in the 500s resurfaces From Ungwana Bay to East Africa's first underwater museum 25-11-2024 by Freddie del Curatolo The wreck of the Portuguese vessel in the waters off Ungwana Bay, north of Malindi, could have a name and a date, and together with its history, the Museums of Kenya could reconstruct the same vessel and turn it into East Africa's first underwater museum. After years of research, which also involved the Italian marine archaeologist Sebastiano Tusa until 2017, before his tragic and untimely death on board the Ethiopian Boeing 747 bound for Kenya, the Kenyan scholar Caesar Bita, a world-renowned underwater archaeologist, seems to have finally come up with concrete results. The vessel, measuring around 20 metres wide and 40 metres long, is said to date back to 1544 and was used by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama during one of his last voyages to the Kenyan coast. The discovery was made public by Bita himself, at the end of the latest patrols together with Portuguese archaeologist Felipe Castro and a pool of foreign experts who collaborated with the Kenyan underwater archaeologists, including Susan Mtakai of the Kenyan Coast Guard, the only woman to work with the archaeologists in underwater research. Research sponsored by American archaeologist Gary Philbrick. During the excavations, the team discovered artefacts used by sailors, including pottery, elephant tusks and other objects. The series of relics found and dated not only allows the reconstruction of the explorer's history, trades and voyages, but also the recreation of the setting. Hence Bita's idea to create an underwater museum in Malindi, reconstructing the vessel and displaying the relics for Kenyan visitors and international tourists. ‘The ivory trade dates back to the 14th century, consequently we know where to start and we will take these pieces of elephant tusks and the pottery to the laboratory to establish their exact age,’ Bita said, pointing out that the discoveries show that the Kenyan coast has been an important trade route for thousands of years. ‘We will build a real model of the ship and allow people to come and learn about its history. Vasco da Gama is believed to have used this ship during his many trade missions to the East African coast. The aim of this excavation is to create a museum to illustrate the history of the East African coast as a trade route for the Romans, Chinese, Portuguese and Arabs,' said the Kenyan researcher.

However, being in an open relationship adds another level of complexity, ensuring that you give your partner proper attention, refrain from stoking their jealousy, and make them feel supported in your atypical arrangement.Danielle, who goes by @Openlycommitted on TikTok, explained how she and her husband, Rich, deal with one of the trickier aspects of being in an open relationship: how to text with the new person you are dating without being rude to your partner. For Danielle, it’s the same tech etiquette you should use in any other relationship.Danielle coaches couples who have open relationships or are considering one to develop a style that works for them.@openlycommittedI have had many people message me asking how to stop their partner from texting a lover, date or another partner in front of them… I think it’s basic texting etiquette to put a phone down when you are one-one-one with another person.

At the dinner table, everyone puts their phones down. And if I'm on a date with someone, whether that's a first date or a boyfriend or my husband or my son… or one-on-one time with a good friend or family member, my phone could distract me the entire time if I let it.

(Image credit: Filipe Castro) A wreck off the coast of Kenya may have been a ship from one of Vasco da Gama's pioneering voyages into the Indian Ocean 500 years ago, archaeologists say.The remains of the vessel, which were discovered near the Kenyan town of Malindi in 2013, are among eight known Portuguese shipwrecks from this period in the area. Researchers think it may be the São Jorge, which sank in 1524, although the identification is not certain.If the wreck is the São Jorge, it may be one of the earliest European shipwrecks in the Indian Ocean, but ""we don't know for sure,"" Filipe Castro, a maritime archaeologist at the University of Coimbra in Portugal and lead author of a new study describing the recent work, told Live Science. According to the study, published Nov. 18 in the Journal of Maritime Archaeology, Castro and his colleagues now hope to verify their identification, in part by conducting an archaeological survey of the coral reefs that stretch north from Malindi to Ras Ngomeni, Kenya — a distance of about 15 miles (25 kilometers).Related: 32 haunting shipwrecks from the ancient worldThe wreck lies about 1,640 feet (500 meters) from the shore, at a depth of about 20 feet (6 meters). Little of it can be seen amid corals on the seabed, but Castro and other divers unearthed timbers from the ship's hull and frame in two archaeological trenches they made at the submerged site.Underwater archaeologists think the wreck is the São Jorge, a Portuguese ship that sank in 1524 during Vasco de Gama's final voyage into the Indian Ocean.

The goal was to create jobs, which turned some Texans into fossil hunters. Amateur fossil hunters collected thousands of fossils from the Texas Coastal Plain, which revealed truths about ancient Texas. 4,000 fossils excavated during the Great Depression revealed that the coast of Texas was once filled with rhinoceros, elephant-like mammals, and ancient wild dogs.https://t.co/PODaNXdsL0#fossils #paleontology pic.twitter.com/98N0zeFkk7 — Earth Archives (@EarthArchivesHQ) November 10, 2024 Steven May, a research associate at UT Austin’s Jackson School of Geosciences, led the research, which was published in the journal Palaeontologia Electronica.

The WPA hired about 8.5 million people to reduce high unemployment. In some parts of Texas, workers were hired to dig up fossils, though they were not professional paleontologists and were paid $0.20 an hour.

Giant rats undergo surprising training to help stop illegal smuggling here's why,https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/tanzania-pouched-rats-wildlife-trafficking-sniff/,2024-11-28,"Photo Credit: APOPO African giant pouched rats, which have previously been trained to sniff out buried mines and detect tuberculosis, are now being used to stop smuggling in Tanzania, The Guardian reported. Endangered wildlife trafficking is a huge problem in the region, with rhinos, elephants, and pangolins being hunted for their body parts. Around $20 billion in illegal animal parts is sold every year, according to stats from Interpol, The Guardian revealed. To combat this, researchers at APOPO, a Belgian nongovernmental organization based in Tanzania, created a study to see whether African pouched rats can play a role in detection. They trained eight pouched rats to sniff out some of the illicit materials being smuggled, including rhino horns, elephant tusks, pangolin scales, and hardwood. Their initial results were promising, The Guardian reported. The rats were able to find the illegal items even when they were hidden in other smelly substances that smugglers had previously used to transport these materials undetected. Rats sorted through peanuts, leaves, washing powder, and wigs to find the contraband. To let the rats do their jobs, the researchers dressed them in red vests, with small beepers they could activate with their paws to alert their handlers. Correctly identifying a sample of contraband earned the rat a treat — all the motivation the clever rodents needed. Not only were the rats successful, they even remembered scents after eight months without exposure, suggesting that they could remember smells as long as sniffer dogs, according to the study. In a real-world simulation in 2023, the rats found 85% of planted samples in the port of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's commercial capital, The Guardian said. Trained rats could become a valuable asset in the fight against wildlife smuggling, which claims the lives of countless endangered animals every year.

Lengthy elephant tusks a health concern - Bangkok Post,https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2907466/lengthy-elephant-tusks-a-health-concern,2024-11-23,"PUBLISHED : 23 Nov 2024 at 18:07 WRITER: Apinya Wipatayotin Small Medium Large Listen to this article Play Pause Veterinarians say Plai Sak Surin is developing health problems including neck muscle strain because of the weight of his overly long tusks. (Photo: Thai Elephant Conservation Center Lampang) An animal welfare group has expressed concern about the possible trimming of Plai Sak Surin’s tusks and whether the elephant might be returned to Sri Lanka to resume his role as a goodwill ambassador.Roger Lohanan, secretary-general of the Thai Animal Guardians Association, raised the issue after the Thai Elephant Conservation Center (TECC) in Lampang issued a statement suggesting that Plai Sak Surin’s tusks may need to be shortened due to their impact on his body structure. The 31-year-old bull elephant has been at the TECC hospital for the last 16 months since returning to Thailand after spending 22 years in Sri Lanka. He was originally gifted to Sri Lanka in 2001 as a goodwill ambassador at the age of seven and was brought back to Thailand in 2023 for medical treatment. According to the TECC, Plai Sak Surin’s long tusks have affected his body structure, prompting the veterinary team to propose trimming them to alleviate the problem. However, the decision will require consultation with all relevant parties. Mr Lohanan questioned who the “relevant parties” are and whether this includes the Sri Lankan government. He noted that it remains unclear whether Sri Lanka permanently relinquished ownership of Plai Sak Surin or temporarily sent him to Thailand for medical care. “What we know is that his overly long, curved tusks — nearly touching the ground — have added weight to his head, causing him difficulties and contributing to health issues,” Mr Lohanan said. “This is similar to humans developing office syndrome.” He explained that long tusks not only negatively affect the elephant’s health but also put his life at risk, as they are highly sought after by both legal and illegal ivory traders. While he agrees with the proposal to trim Plai Sak Surin’s tusks, he raised questions about what will happen to the removed tusks and whether the elephant will ultimately be returned to Sri Lanka. Mr Lohanan called on the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation to carefully study international law and provide clear answers to the public. According to TECC director Taweepoke Angkawanish, Plai Sak Surin has suffered from both internal and external health issues, including a cataract-like condition in his right eye, a deformed front left leg, and impaired kidney function. Treatments have steadily improved his condition. However, the elephant’s excessively long tusks are affecting his body structure, particularly the muscles around his head and neck. Discussions are ongoing to determine a plan for reducing the length of his tusks. KEYWORDS Plai Sak Surin Tusks Sri Lanka Elephant Goodwill ambassador Do you",2959,True,0

However, further advice is needed before the procedure can be performed.Sak Surin came under public attention in mid-2022 when Thai conservationists raised concerns about his poor health. Donated to Sri Lanka nearly two decades ago, the elephant was reportedly chained and used for ceremonial purposes.Thai veterinarians and handlers treated Sak Surin in Sri Lanka before his repatriation in July 2023, which was delayed due to his health condition.

The tournament will be hosted across six cities in Morocco from next December with the final being held on January 18, 2026. Ivory Coast will attempt to defend their title after beating Nigeria on home soil earlier this year with Sébastien Haller the hero for the Elephants after they famously sacked their coach during the tournament. The best players in Africa will descend on Morocco next year including Egypt’s Mohamed Salah, Nigeria’s Victor Osimhen and Morocco’s Ashraf Hakimi. The aforementioned trio are currently the three most valuable African players in the world but which nations have the most valuable collection of players in their current squads? Using Trasnsfermarkt’s world-renowned market values, we’ve ranked the 24 nations at AFCON 2025 based on their squad’s valuations. The most valuable nations to qualify for AFCON 2025 Of the 24 nations to qualify for AFCON, Morocco have the most valuable squad at €361 million. PSG star Hakimi is the second most valuable African player in the world at €60m and they have six other players valued at over €20m, including Brahim Díaz and Noussair Mazraoui. One Moroccan player to keep an eye on is Monaco wonderkid Eliesse Ben Seghir as his market value could soar before the tournament. As the graphic below illustrates, Nigeria ranks second with Osimhen the most valuable African player at €75m. Reigning champions Ivory Coast rank third with Sporting CP’s Ousmane Diomande (€40m) and Brighton’s Simon Adingra (€30m) their two most valuable players. Ghana are the most valuable African nation to miss out as they rank fifth with a total squad value of €212m. Salah will be aiming to lead Egypt to glory in Morocco with the Liverpool icon supported by one of the breakthrough stars of the 2024/25 season in Frankfurt sensation Omar Marmoush.

The vessel , measuring approximately 20 metres wide and 40 metres long, is believed to have been used by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama during one of his final voyages to the Kenyan coast. Dating back to 1544, the ship has been the focus of excavation efforts over the past two weeks, with foreign experts collaborating with Kenya’s underwater archaeologists. The team discovered artefacts used by the sailors, including pottery, elephant tusks and other items during the excavation. National Museum of Kenya underwater archaeologist Caesar Bita, who has been leading the excavation exercise, said the discoveries prove that the Kenyan coast had been an important trade route for thousands of years. “The ivory business dates back to the 14th century, therefore, we will take these pieces of the elephants’ tusks and the pottery to the laboratory to establish their exact age,” Bita said. The ship could have been built in the 16th century, the archaeologist said, adding a museum of the shipwreck will be set up offshore at Ras Ngomeni. They will also establish the first underwater museum. “Vasco da Gama is believed to have used this vessel during his many trade missions in the East African coastline. The objective of this excavation is to establish a museum that will showcase the history of the East African coast as a trade route for the Romans, Chinese, Portuguese and Arabs,” he said. “We will build a replica of the vessel and allow the people to come and learn the history.” Also in the team is Susan Mtakai from the Kenya Coast Guard Service, who is the only woman working with the archaeologists in the excavation. The exercise has been sponsored by US archaeologist Garry Philbrick. Philbrick, 77, said he is proud to be part of and contribute to the worthy cause of trying to understand the history of the Kenyan coast at the beautiful site of Ngomeni. “Well, the experience has been emotional, but I’m so happy for the people of Ngomeni for what’s coming in the future, for their lives and their careers. I hope, wish and pray that it will be here for a very long time for many long behind me to come and view,” he said. ""The shipwreck is a significantly large structure because of the size of the timber frames and planks on the bottom,"" Philbrick said. Prof Filipe Castro, a Portuguese underwater archaeologist, said they have assessed the site of the shipwreck to understand the structure of the ship. “We also want to know the situation then, or how many artefacts are still there and how much it will take to fully excavate it. The site is amazing,” he said. The Professor said the Portuguese lost eight ships on the coast of Kenya, which they believe are at Ngomeni. These could be São Jorge, of the third fleet of Vasco da Gama and Nossa Senhora da Graça, (Our Lady of the Grace) of 1544. “We still don’t know which one it is, but they are both really interesting because we know these ships were amazing machines, but we do not know how they were built, how big they were, how they were put together and how they were designed,” he said. They were interested in knowing the occupants of the vessels and their activities at the coast. “We know they had friends here at Malindi and the Portuguese came here for water and food. But still, there is so much to know and we can learn so much from the artefacts that we are going to find on the site,” he said. “This is going to be a project that will continue giving LOREEN WAMALWACoastCourt suspends construction of high-rise building in MalindiJustice Mwangi Njoroge issued the ruling on Tuesday after certifying as urgent an application by resident Valentini9mon agoCHARLES MGHENYICoastMost Popular1Birth certificate in a day?

Ivory Coast farmers say early Harmattan winds could affect cocoa crops - CNBC Africa,https://www.cnbcafrica.com/wire/653640/,,"Ivory Coast farmers say early Harmattan winds could affect cocoa crops ABIDJAN, Nov 18 (Reuters) – Dry Harmattan winds could begin to blow early this season in Ivory Coast and this would cause a shortage of cocoa beans from February, farmers said on Monday. The world’s top cocoa producer is in its dry season that runs from mid-November to March, when downpours are scarce. Last week, rains were mainly below average in most of Ivory Coast’s main cocoa growing regions but good soil moisture content boosted the October-to-March main crop, farmers said. They added that many beans were leaving the bush and that harvesting would continue until January. However, farmers said they expected seasonal winds to start blowing early this year. The Harmattan, which usually sweeps in between December and March from the Sahara desert, can harm cocoa pods and dry the soil, making beans smaller. “Everything is fine for the moment, but there are fears that the Harmattan will arrive early this year and be strong,” said Ernest Krou, who farms near the west-central region of Daloa, where 0.7 millimetre (mm) of rain fell last week, 8.3 mm below the five-year average. Similar comments were made in the central regions of Bongouanou and Yamoussoukro, where rains were below average. In the western region of Soubre and in the southern region of Divo, where rains were also below average, and in the southern region of Agboville and in the eastern region of Abengourou, where rains were above average, farmers said cocoa deliveries from the bush were rising. They also said that the size and the quality of the crop in February and March would depend on weather conditions that would last until late December. “If the dry season is not intense and rains are well distributed in December, there will be enough harvesting between February and March,” said Salame Kone, who farms near Soubre, where 6.6 mm of rain fell last week, 12.9 mm below the five-year average. Average temperatures across the West African country last week ranged from 27 to 28.7 degrees Celsius.

Backed by public and private sources, including Ivory Coast’s government, the Global Environment Facility, and the Green Climate Fund, this initiative underscores the country’s dedication to combating climate change. Ivory Coast, the leading global cocoa producer, is also introducing legislation to support other green finance efforts, including carbon credit management.

Phillips commented on the discovery: ""I was kind of open-mouthed when I saw the picture. I thought, 'OK, well, cool, a tusk. Wait a second, it’s so curved. Holy cow, this is a mammoth tusk.'"" Knewz.com noted that the find was later confirmed as a Columbian mammoth tusk, dating back 11,700 to 75,000 years from the Ice Age era. This had been a special discovery, as no complete tusk had ever been found in the Mississippi creek banks. Templeton had been collecting fossils since he was a child and stated that this was one of his top two discoveries, the other being an entire mastodon mandible he had found in 1996. He added, ""Now I want to find a mammoth tooth. Now that I know a mammoth died right here, I'm optimistic that I'll find a mammoth tooth."" Templeton told CNN, ""It was exciting to find a big piece of a tusk, certainly. But it was particularly exciting that it was a mammoth. After the geologists got there, and we started uncovering it and realized that it was the entire tusk, from tip to base, it was even",1370,True,0

Researchers Recreating Viking Boat Trips Uncover Trade Links With Arctic Indigenous People,https://twistedsifter.com/2024/11/researchers-recreating-viking-boat-trips-uncover-trade-links-with-arctic-indigenous-people/,2024-11-17,"November 17, 2024 at 3:49 pm Archaeologists from an international research team, led by academics at Lund University, Sweden, have uncovered Viking-era trade deals with the Indigenous People of the Arctic. The team set out to understand the origins of ivory products sold and collected in Europe during Medieval times. Whilst ivory is largely banned in the twenty-first century, due to the cruelty associated with the ivory trade, in Medieval Europe it was a luxury product. The rich and elite people in Medieval society – as in many societies thereafter – would proudly collect and display expensive ivory items. While we usually associate ivory with elephant tusks, there are other sources of the material. As the researchers discovered, many of the European ivory products were actually obtained from walrus tusks. With this knowledge in mind, the researchers were able to extract DNA from the ivory and use genetic fingerprinting techniques to determine where exactly the walruses who were killed for their tusks had once lived. The findings determined that the walrus tusks had been obtained from the Arctic. In a statement from Lund University, Professor of Archaeology Peter Jordan explained their shock when uncovering this geographical data: “What really surprised us was that much of the walrus ivory exported back to Europe was originating in very remote hunting grounds located deep into the High Arctic. Previously, it has always been assumed that the Norse simply hunted walrus close to their main settlements in southwest Greenland.” With the Vikings known ivory traders, this led the researchers to a further line of inquiry. The next step in their project was determining exactly how and where they obtained the Arctic walrus ivory. This was most curious, since the team’s prior knowledge of the Vikings didn’t support the idea of them venturing deep into the arctic and killing walruses. To address this uncertainty, doctoral researcher Greer Jarrett set sail on traditional Norwegian boats,",2009,True,0

They are well known for their majestic size and brilliant tusks, which also makes them a good catch for hunters and ivory dealers. For years now, studies have estimated that their numbers are declining at a fast pace, a fresh study has backed this prediction with alarming numbers. The study,  there must have been as many as 3-5 million. While the condition all over is despicable, some regions have shown positive increase too. For example, both the species are particularly thriving in parts of southern Africa, particularly in Botswana. Pendjari National Park in Benin is the only example of where forest elephants are increasing in western Africa. 115343779Study author George Wittemyer, a professor at Colorado State University's wildlife department, said that the paper focuses on the scale of the declines and how widespread they are across the continent. The Sahel region which has been torn by war, saw decline in their elephant population due to the destruction of natural habitats. On the other hand, Eastern and central Africa's Elephant population saw a decline due to the ivory poaching as well as from human population growth and conversion of their land into buildings. 115343782Kenya, Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania haven't done much better. To add to that there are reports that claim that Kenya shoots between 50 and 120 problem elephants each year.

Opinion | Why India's Ivory Tower Historians Need To Heed Dalrymple - News18,https://www.news18.com/opinion/opinion-why-indias-ivory-tower-historians-need-to-heed-dalrymple-9122278.html,2024-11-16,"It won’t be long before the ultimate insult will be lobbed at William Dalrymple—of being an agent of the regressive forces that extoll the greatness of ancient India and seek to “rewrite"" history to conform to that supposedly contestable idea. It would mark the ultimate desification of the Scotsman who won his laurels as a chronicler of India’s Mughal and British past but has now daringly gone down The Golden Road to rediscover the subcontinent’s ancient glories. Any controversy is good publicity, so Dalrymple’s broadside at India’s historians is well-timed and well-directed. In his characteristically earthy style, he recently averred that the cryptic academic language that Indian historians used for decades is the reason why average Indians believe the often wild theories put forth by “WhatsApp University"" about controversial aspects of history. That observation hurts, but Dalrymple cannot be accused of inaccuracy on this count. India’s “professional"" historians are proud of their sesquipedalian dissertations and rear up indignantly at criticism. And they hit back at the few of their ilk who actually have the felicity of prose by calling them “popular"" historians, making a sort of pop-crooner-versus-classical-vocalist comparison. The subtext is that those who write that way lack gravitas and may actually be inferior given their need to be understood by people other than just their fellow academics. Dalrymple, a ‘qualified’ historian even if he has never taught the subject—not that it is a prerequisite to be called one anyway—has evidently touched a raw nerve. However, Dalrymple only identified part of the problem. The lack of engaging prose is a definite put-off, but so is the choice of content. The ‘professional’ historians’ disdainful approach to aspects of India’s past bordered on contempt, so people turned to other sources of information. The Indian historians’ pedestrian prose is a subset of a larger problem. Clarity of language largely stopped being valued at about the same time as the older generation of teachers, especially Anglo-Indians, retired and were replaced by products of a school system that downgraded English. This also coincided with the increasing prevalence of badly written school-level textbooks for all subjects, including history, which students were mandated to memorise. The result was that banal prose became entrenched in the system, which was then overlaid with Marxist vocabulary by the next generation of academics. As the ideological wagons circled, abstruse language added another barrier to the entrance of new voices with possibly new ideas. Now ‘professional’ Indian historians aver that writing in enigmatic academic code has been the norm and they are merely adhering to an accepted international practice. But a perusal of the works of some of the most revered Indian historians of an earlier era belies such claims. They did not bury their arguments in inscrutable prose and annotations. Significantly, many of them were also not of the same ideology as the group dominant today in Indian academia and therefore have been sidelined as obsolete. And their place has been taken by practitioners of jargon-ridden, dense writing in the name of a kind of academic Esperanto. Many western historians, however, manage to maintain a balance between academic rigour and accessible prose. Nor is their “popularity"" unequivocally seen as a drawback unlike the way ‘professional’ Indian historians use that word. Historians",3490,True,0

New York Ivory Ban for Antiques Dealers Voided by US Appeals Court,https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2024-11-13/new-york-ivory-ban-for-antiques-dealers-voided-by-us-appeals-court,2024-11-13,"By Jonathan StempelNEW YORK (Reuters) -A federal appeals court on Wednesday declared unconstitutional part of a New York law that imposed tough limits on the sale of ivory and rhinoceros horns, voiding restrictions on sales and in-store displays by antiques dealers.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan nonetheless let stand much of the 2014 law, agreeing with New York and animal rights advocates that the law signed by then-Governor Andrew Cuomo was not preempted by federal law.In striking part of the law, the court called it broader than necessary to promote New York's substantial interest in stopping illegal ivory sales in the state, noting that it also covered goods that could be sold legally interstate or internationally.In a joint opinion, Circuit Judges Pierre Leval and Myrna Perez said forbidding dealers from communicating ""crucially important"" information to lawful buyers about the quality and authenticity of ivory goods was an ""excessive burden"" on speech.Starting in 1973, Congress largely banned ivory sales through the federal Endangered Species Act, but has provided exceptions for goods that were less than 50% ivory.New York's law went further, providing exceptions only for goods that were less than 20% ivory, and subjecting violators to fines of $3,000 and larger.Sponsors said New York's law was needed because elephant and rhinoceros populations were declining in Africa and Asia, with 96 elephants slaughtered each day.Ivory comes from elephant tusks. Animal rights groups have estimated the global ivory trade at $23 billion annually.A spokesperson for New York's Department of Environmental Conservation, which enforces the ivory law, said the agency is reviewing the decision.The law had been challenged by the Art and Antique Dealers League of America and the National Antique and Art Dealers Association of America.Their lawyer Caleb Trotter, of the Pacific Legal Foundation, said the decision showed New York went too far in restricting the marketing of ""lawful antiques and works of art.""Circuit Judge Richard Sullivan dissented from the decision, saying the Endangered Species Act preempted New York's law. He agreed that the speech restrictions were improper.Ralph Henry, senior director of litigation for the Humane Society, which was involved in the case, welcomed the decision, saying the court ""upheld the law to eliminate the illegal ivory and rhino horn trade within (New York's) own borders.""The case is Art and Antique Dealers League of America Inc et al v.

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)TOPICS:Al SharptonWoke DemocratsIvory towerCivil rightsPolice reformEveryday problemsCollege campusesLatte liberalsWASHINGTON (TNND) — Civil rights activist Al Sharpton said Monday that “woke” Democrats have been in an ""ivory tower taking a nap"" and have neglected to address issues impacting Americans. “The woke people, I don’t know what they woke from, because we were never asleep,” Sharpton said during a Monday appearance on MSNBC. “They were the ones up in the ivory tower taking a nap while we were dealing with people on the ground that have everyday problems.”He added that protesters on college campuses were selective with the causes they defended. Protesters at schools across the U.S. have demonstrated against investments in companies believed to be helping Israel in its war against Hamas terrorists.They also occurred while “common people” were trying to pay for their children’s colleges, help them get admitted and process student loans, Sharpton noted.“The causes on the ground that everyday people had to deal with, they were absent ... which is why many people when they raised the problem came back to us,” he explained.“Latte liberals” have also represented people and things that were never part of original messages, according to Sharpton, who pointed to calls to defund police.“All of us that were on the forefront, and still are, of police reform never said ‘defund the police,’” Sharpton said. “We were trying to get police of color and of other circumstances up in these departments to deal with stop-and-frisk and deal with other things.”Sharpton, who spoke at the 2024 Democratic National Convention, said he has worked alongside other civil rights leaders to reform existing systems rather than replace them, he added.“The whole goal of the civil rights movement and the movement now is to correct the system, not to overthrow the system, and to make things work equally for everyone, not to just upturn everything and change everything to some undefined utopia,” Sharpton said.Have questions, concerns or tips?

Report says religion at heart of illegal ivory trade,https://www.religionnews.com/faith/international/Report-says-religion-at-heart-of-illegal-ivory-trade?&ms=IngersollInstagram,2012-09-18,"Skip to content Mastodon WASHINGTON (RNS) Since the ban on international trade of ivory in 1989, the ivory black market has been on the rise, and a National Geographic investigation found that demand for religious art pieces carved out of the precious material has played a considerable role. The largest ivory crucifix in the Philippines hangs in a museum in Manila. The body of Christ, 30 inches long, is carved from a single tusk. The piece dates to the early 1600s, when Spanish galleons began bringing Asian ivory craftsmanship to Spain and the New World. “No matter where I find ivory, religion is close at hand,” said investigative reporter Bryan Christy, whose article, “Ivory Worship,” is included in the new edition of National Geographic magazine, released Friday (Sept. 14). “Elephant poaching levels are currently at their worst in a decade,” Christy wrote. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) estimates that at least 25,000 elephants were poached in 2011, mostly for their ivory tusks. Philippine Catholics use ivory to construct crucifixes, figures of the Virgin Mary and other icons. The province of Cebu is particularly known for its ivory renditions of the Santo Nino de Cebu (Holy Child of Cebu), used in worship and celebration. Christy said the Vatican has not taken active steps to discourage ivory trade, which primarily comes from illegal sources. “The Vatican has recently demonstrated a commitment to confronting transnational criminal problems … but it has not signed the CITES treaty and so is not subject to the ivory ban.” “The elephant is a symbol of Thailand and is revered in Buddhism,” Christy wrote. Buddhist tradition holds that the Buddha's mother dreamed of a white elephant the night he was conceived, making ivory carvings and amulets even  and columns you want, free of charge (and we hope you read a lot of them!)

The bodies of two stillborn infants were found Sunday morning at a landfill site in Akouedo, east Abidjan, along with ""medical equipment and fibroids that had apparently been dumped by a clinic or by a hospital"", said the city's chief of police Kollo Roger Yeo. Deputy Director-General for Public Safety Siaka Dosso also confirmed the presence of ""human waste, including fibroids and umbilical cords"". He said police had launched an investigation. ""Mothers sometimes abandon newborns and we find them, alive or dead,"" said Dosso, adding that finding ""human waste"" was less common.

Rats trained to sniff out smuggled rhino horn and pangolin scales - National Observer,https://www.nationalobserver.com/2024/11/08/news/rats-smuggled-rhino-horn-pangolin-scales,2024-11-06,"Listen to article This story was originally published by The Guardian and appears here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.Rats could be the latest weapon deployed in the fight against endangered wildlife trafficking, according to a study of rodents trained to sniff out pangolin scales, rhino horns, elephant tusks and hardwood.Researchers trained eight African giant pouched rats to sniff out the contraband, even when it was hidden among items commonly used to hide trafficked goods, including peanuts, leaves, wigs and washing powder.The market for illegal wildlife products is worth up to $20bn (£15.5bn) annually, Interpol said last year.The rats were studied by scientists at Apopo, a Belgian-founded, Tanzania-based NGO, whose rodents also sniff out landmines and tuberculosis. Named after conservationists including David Attenborough, the animals were initially rewarded with a food pellet if they held their nose for three seconds over a sample of pangolin scale, wood, rhino horn or elephant ivory. Rats trained to sniff out smuggled rhino horn and pangolin scales. #IllegalWildlifeTrade #Wildlife #EndangeredSpecies In simulations, they were dressed in tiny red vests attached to leashes, with a beeper attached to the front so they could use their front paws to alert their handlers when they found contraband – for which they would receive another reward of food.The rats were able to perfectly detect pangolin, wood and rhino horn after eight months of not smelling them, according to Apopo’s study, which was published in the journal Frontiers in Conservation Science. The researchers said this suggested that rats could remember smells for as long as sniffer dogs. But, they said, their results for elephant ivory may not be accurate, as that had been stored with the rhino horn and rats trained only on rhino horn sniffed it out.In 2023, the rats were also put to the test in a real-world simulation in the port of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania’s commercial capital. The rats found 85% of planted illegal wildlife samples, Apopo said, even through vents in shipping containers. November 8th 2024",2114,True,0

APOPO, a non-profit organization devoted to training rats and other scent detection animals for humanitarian purposes, is behind this unique operation.

Ivory Surrender Events Encourage Public to Toss The Tusk to Save Elephants,https://communitynewspapers.com/kendallgazette/ivory-surrender-events-encourage-public-to-toss-the-tusk-to-save-elephants/,2024-11-07,"To help protect elephants, the Association of Zoos & Aquariums’ Wildlife Trafficking Alliance (WTA) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are teaming up for a second time to organize a series of ivory surrender events that will encourage public participation in the fight to save elephants from wildlife trafficking. During “Toss the Tusk” events taking place at three leading zoos accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA)—San Diego Zoo, Phoenix Zoo, and Zoo Miami—the public can bring unwanted ivory to be properly disposed. “Worldwide demand for ivory is decimating elephant populations, and we must act quickly to save them from extinction,” said Dan Ashe, President and CEO, Association of Zoos & Aquariums. “By surrendering these items, the public can help ensure that they will no longer fuel demand and help us send the message that ivory belongs to elephants – living elephants.” “Wildlife trafficking threatens the survival of elephants and other imperiled species across the world,” said Martha Williams, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director. “By working with the AZA, WTA and other partner organizations, we reduce consumer demand for illegal wildlife products. Toss the Tusk events give members of the public a chance to help combat wildlife trafficking and create a brighter future for elephants and other species at risk.” Thousands of elephants are killed each year to fuel the global demand for ivory. African elephant populations alone have fallen from an estimated 12 million a century ago to around 415,000 individuals as of 2016. As a result of global conservation efforts, poaching rates have been slightly, yet steadily, declining over the past few years across Africa, but elephants are still being lost faster than they can reproduce. International commercial trade in the ivory of elephants is prohibited under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). In the United States, elephants are protected by the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The ivory trade is further restricted by the African Elephant Conservation Act and other laws. In 2016, a near-total ban on the commercial trade of African elephant ivory went into effect in the United States. However, these regulations do not restrict personal possession of ivory.

Trained Rats Able to Sniff Out Smuggled Rhino Horns - Yale E360,https://e360.yale.edu/digest/trained-rats-smuggled-wildlife,2024-11-06,"Search Search Trained Rats Able to Sniff Out Smuggled Rhino Horns This article was originally published by The Guardian and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. A rat trained to sniff out illegally trafficked wildlife. Maria Anna Caneva Saccardo Caterina / Apopo / SWNS Rats could be the latest weapon deployed in the fight against endangered wildlife trafficking, according to a study of rodents trained to sniff out pangolin scales, rhino horns, elephant tusks, and hardwood. Researchers trained eight African giant pouched rats to sniff out the contraband, even when it was hidden among items commonly used to hide trafficked goods, including peanuts, leaves, wigs, and washing powder. The market for illegal wildlife products is worth up to $20 billion annually, Interpol said last year. The rats were studied by scientists at Apopo, a Belgian-founded, Tanzania-based NGO, whose rodents also sniff out land mines and tuberculosis. Named after conservationists including David Attenborough, the animals were initially rewarded with a food pellet if they held their nose for three seconds over a sample of pangolin scale, wood, rhino horn, or elephant ivory. In simulations, they were dressed in tiny red vests attached to leashes, with a beeper attached to the front so they could use their front paws to alert their handlers when they found contraband — for which they would receive another reward of food. The rats were able to perfectly detect pangolin, wood, and rhino horn after eight months of not smelling them, according to Apopo’s study, which was published in the journal Frontiers in Conservation Science. The researchers said this suggested that rats could remember smells for as long as sniffer dogs. But, they said, their results for elephant ivory may not be accurate, as that had been stored with the rhino horn and rats trained only on rhino horn sniffed it out. In 2023, the rats were also put to the test in a real-world simulation in the port of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania’s commercial capital. The rats found 85 percent of planted illegal wildlife samples, Apopo said, even through vents in shipping containers. —Rachel Savage, The Guardian ALSO ON YALE E360 How Traffickers Got Away with the Biggest Rosewood Heist in History",2272,True,0

Sign up for our free newslettersIn gangster movies, mob bosses worry that a “rat” will betray them. Now, criminal wildlife poachers might need to start fearing real rats.Scientists have trained giant African rats to sniff out rhino horns, pangolin scales, elephant tusks and tropical hardwoods – all endangered species favored by smugglers.With their low cost, ability to squeeze into tight spots, and remarkable knack for remembering and distinguishing between scents, these oversized rodents could give law enforcement a leg up in their struggle to catch illegal shipments of wildlife, the researchers reported at the end of October in Frontiers in Conservation Science.“Existing screening tools are expensive and time intensive and there is an urgent need to increase cargo screening,” said Isabelle Szott, who helped lead the research as a scientist at APOPO, a Tanzania-based organization that has made headlines training rats the size of small housecats to detect odors from land mines and people infected with tuberculosis.Wildlife trafficking is a globe-spanning criminal enterprise worth as much as $23 billion a year. It has helped drive precipitous declines in charismatic species such as African elephants, whose numbers fell by 30% between 2007 and 2014. Over the last decade, an estimated 11,000 rhinos were poached, chiefly for their horns. Recommended Reading:Scientists glimpse into the Internet-fueled global trade in insects, spiders, and scorpions These smuggling operations often escape detection because they blend into the flood of goods flowing across borders in the global economy. Inspectors at ports can screen just a fraction of all shipments with costly x-ray machines. Specially trained dogs can home in on the smells of some illegal animal parts, but a single dog costs up to $30,000 and typically must be accompanied by a skilled handler.That’s where Kirsty, Marty, Attenborough, Irwin, Betty, Teddy, Ivory, Ebony, Desmond, Thoreau, and Fossey all come in. Those are the names given to the African rats trained and tested by APOPO to see if their sensitive snouts could be harnessed to call attention to contraband wildlife.The rats went through an exhaustive training process, in which they were exposed to smells from bits of rhino horn, elephant tusk, pangolin scales and East African blackwood, a slow-growing plant whose wood is prized for musical instruments and decorations. Small containers of each substance were placed behind a plastic panel that contained holes into which a rat could poke its snout. Other containers held pieces of innocuous materials often found around illegal shipments, including electrical cables, plastic hair wigs, coffee beans and washing detergent. Later, some contained a mix, to see if the animals could tease out illegal shipments hidden with other items.When the rat held its snout inside the hole that led to one of the illegal items for a certain amount of time, it would automatically receive a small bit of food as a reward. At the end of their training, the rats had a 99% hit rate on rhino horn, 90% for elephant tusk, and",3421,True,0

Ivory Coast Harvest Pressures Weigh on Cocoa Prices - The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/commodities/SBV17/pressreleases/29404607/ivory-coast-harvest-pressures-weigh-on-cocoa-prices/,2024-11-05,"December ICE NY cocoa (CCZ24) today is down -92 (-1.26%), and December ICE London cocoa #7 (CAZ24) is down -141 (-2.43%). Cocoa prices are under pressure today for a second day as the pace of the Ivory Coast cocoa harvest accelerates. Monday's government data showed that Ivory Coast farmers shipped 365,072 MT of cocoa to ports from October 1 to November 3, up +26% from 288,686 MT shipped the same time last year. The Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa producer. Cocoa prices were also undercut when the Ivory Coast regulator Le Conseil Cafe-Cacao on October 18 raised its Ivory Coast 2024/25 cocoa production estimate to a range of 2.1-2.2 MMT from a June forecast of 2.0 MMT. Recent global cocoa demand news has been mixed. The National Confectioners Association on October 17 reported that North American Q3 cocoa grindings rose +12% y/y to 109,264 MT. Also, the Cocoa Association of Asia reported that Q3 Asian cocoa grinding rose +2.6% y/y to 216,998 MT. However, the European Cocoa Association reported that European Q3 cocoa grindings fell -3.3% y/y to 354,335 MT. Shrinking global cocoa stockpiles are bullish for prices. ICE-monitored cocoa inventories held in US ports have been trending lower for the past 17 months and fell to a 19-year low Monday of 1,747,511 bags. Cocoa found support after Ghana's Cocoa Board (Cocobod) on August 20 cut its 2024/25 Ghana cocoa production estimate to 650,000 MT from a June forecast of 700,000 MT. Due to bad weather and crop disease, Ghana's 2023/24 coca harvest sank to a 23-year low of 425,000 MT. Ghana is the world's second-biggest cocoa producer, and its 2024/25 cocoa harvest begins in October. An increase in cocoa production by Cameroon, the world's fifth-largest cocoa producer, is bearish for cocoa prices. On August 21, Cameroon's National Cocoa and Coffee Board reported that in 2023/24 (Aug/July), Cameroon cocoa production rose +1.2% y/y to 266,725. Also, Nigeria's August cocoa exports rose by +6.8% y/y to 14,984 MT. Nigeria is the world's sixth-largest cocoa producer. In a bullish factor, the International Cocoa Association (ICCO) on August 30 raised its 2023/24 global cocoa deficit estimate to -462,000 MT from May's -439,000 MT, the largest deficit in over 60 years. ICCO also cut its 2023/24 cocoa production estimate to 4.330 MMT from May's 4.461 MMT. ICCO projected a 2023/24 global cocoa stocks/grindings ratio of a 46-year low of 27.4%.

Persistent rains have boosted cocoa arrivals at the ports of Abidjan and San Pedro by 26% year-on-year as of November 3, hitting 365,000 metric tons since October 1, aligning with market expectations. However, excessive moisture brings quality concerns. Reports of brown rot are rising, which could reduce anticipated yields after December. Between 20% and 25% of crops are arriving in poor condition due to mold and incomplete fermentation. The unusually wet weather in October and November, which limits sunlight, complicates drying the beans. Mold and high moisture may hinder the forecasted 10% growth of the main crop for the 2024/25 season, as per the CCC.Why should I care?For markets: Quality concerns cloud cocoa prospects.Declining cocoa quality could influence prices and supply. Market participants might face volatility, as lower-quality yields could trigger shortages or raise costs, affecting global supply chains and the pricing of chocolate products.The bigger picture: Weather’s role in global agriculture.As climate patterns grow unpredictable, cocoa's challenges highlight broader agricultural lessons.

The clever rodents who are ratting out cruel smugglers to help fight the war on wildlife crimes,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/clever-rodents-who-ratting-out-34037773,2024-11-05,"Rats are dismissed as vermin and blamed for being transmitters of diseases such as the bubonic plague. They also terrify many people and are incorrectly thought of as being dirty. But in East Africa, their intelligence has been valued after a border force of eight giant pouched rats has been trained to fight the multimillion pound illegal wildlife trade. Wearing tiny uniforms and rewarded with mashed avocado and nuts, it is hoped the new recruits will be able to sniff out the most commonly smuggled animal and plant parts - including pangolin scales, rhino horns, elephant tusks and hardwood - in a new attempt to save endangered species. The hero rats, given names including Attenborough and Fossey after the famous conservationists, were studied by scientists at Apopo, a Tanzania-based NGO, whose rodents also sniff out landmines and tuberculosis. In trials, the rodents were dressed in tiny red vests attached to leashes, with a beeper on the front so they could use handlers when they found contraband. They would then receive a reward of food. They have proved to be as capable as any detection dog, according to research published yesterday in Frontiers in Conservation Science. But being small enough to squeeze into tightly packed shipping containers has given them an advantage over their canine colleagues. Interpol says the market for illegal wildlife products is worth up to £15.5bn annually.",1410,True,0

LUCIE, FL - A Florida man, Omarion Ivory, 18, of Port St. Lucie, was arrested Wednesday for the murder of 67-year-old Francis Gennace. Police have stated that they believe Ivory's arrest may have stopped a potential serial killer cold. As reported by WFLA, a spokesman for the Port St. Lucie Police Department said that Ivory was arrested while already in custody at the St. Lucie Jail where he was incarcerated in connection with a prior arrest on September 20th. PSLPD Assistant Chief Leo Niemczyk told reporters, ""We may have had an undetected serial killer in the works."" On September 12th, Police were alerted to perform a welfare check on Gennace after he failed to report for work for several days. They found the man dead, having suffered a horrific attack with 45 stab wounds to his head and neck, per the arrest report. A four-inch knife was found at the scene. Police said another knife was found in his bedroom, but they are uncertain where it came from. Gennace's wife was out fo town at the time and he seemed to be preparing a meal when he answered his door and was brutally attacked. Investigators reported no signs of forced entry. The outlet wrote that law enforcement conducted a detailed review of over 600 hours of surveillance footage from the neighboring homes and found that Ivory was seen, potentially casing the area four days before, and then leaving after about 30 minutes. Eight days after the police found Gennace, Ivory was arrested while banging on the windows of a woman's home while armed with a hammer. He reportedly fled from police on a bicycle before being apprehended. According to officials, the woman lived alone. Niemczyk told a news conference, “All accounts lead us to believe that Mr. Ivory was probably preparing to commit a second homicide that day. A second random act and a second person not known to him. We may have had an undetected serial killer in the works.” Once officers were able to examine Ivory's weapons, his fingerprints were found to match and blood on the hammer was confirmed as Gennace's, shoe patterns at the scene were also matched to Ivory's footwear.

Giant rats could help detect illegal wildlife trade,https://earthsky.org/earth/giant-rats-sniffing-detect-illegal-wildlife-trade/,2024-11-03,"The 2025 EarthSky Lunar Calendar presale is here! First 100 purchases signed by the legendary Deborah Byrd as a thank you. Get yours today! Frontiers published this original article on October 29, 2024. Edits by EarthSky. Pangolin scales, elephant tusks, rhino horn and a rare wood are preferred objects in the illegal wildlife trade. African giant pouched rats, with their keen sense of smell, however, could soon help to intercept this trade. Researchers showed the rats can successfully sniff out parts of endangered animals and remember the scent months after training. Employing them in the field could increase pressure on wildlife smugglers and add a flexibly deployable tool to screen cargo, the researchers said. In the past, African giant pouched rats have learned to detect explosives and the tuberculosis-causing pathogen. Now, a team of researchers have trained these rats to pick up the scent of pangolin scales, elephant ivory, rhino horn and African blackwood. These animals and plants are threatened and at high danger of extinction. Isabelle Szott, a researcher at the Okeanos Foundation, is the first co-author of the study published in Frontiers in Conservation Science. Szott said: First co-author Kate Webb, an assistant professor at Duke University, added: The researchers conducted their study at APOPO, a Tanzania-based, non-profit organization that provides a low-tech, cost-efficient solutions to pressing humanitarian challenges. The rats – Kirsty, Marty, Attenborough, Irwin, Betty, Teddy, Ivory, Ebony, Desmond, Thoreau and Fossey, some of them named after conservationists and advocates against wildlife trafficking – underwent several training stages. During indication training, the rats learned to hold their noses for several seconds in a hole where the target was. When they correctly performed this ‘nose poke,’ they received a reward with flavored rodent pellets. In the next step, researchers introduced the rats to non-target odors. These included electric cables, coffee beans and washing powder. Smugglers frequently use these objects to mask the scent of wildlife in real-life trafficking operations. Szott said: Researchers also trained the rats to remember smells. At the end of their retention training, they were reintroduced to scents they’d not encountered for five and eight months, respectively. Despite months of non-exposure, the rats showed perfect retention scores, suggesting that their cognitive retention performance resembles that of dogs. By the end of the training, eight rats were able to identify four commonly smuggled wildlife species among 146 non-target substances. Szott explained: The next step, the scientists said, is to develop ways for the rats to work within ports through which smugglers trafficked wildlife. For this purpose, researchers will outfit the rats with custom-made vests. With their front paws, they will be able to pull a small ball attached at the chest of their vest, which emits a beeping sound. This way rats will be able to alert their handlers when they detect a target. Webb said: This proof-of-principle study demonstrates that rats can successfully identify trafficked wildlife. This does not mean that it comes without limitations, the researchers said. For example, they conducted the study in a controlled environment, which is not reflective of the settings in which wildlife is commonly trafficked or screened by scent-detection animals. To deploy rats for this task, the researchers said they would need to develop new methods. Webb concluded: Bottom line: Researchers are training giant rats to sniff out illegal wildlife samples in an effort to curb the trade of these materials.

Now, animal rights groups want the African elephant moved again.Free All Captive Elephants (FACE), a South Florida-based advocacy organization, has filed a complaint with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) asking that Asha be seized from Two Tails Ranch on Northeast 81st Street.She’s been living there since last December.FACE filed its complaint on Oct. 1, citing what it insists was the ranch’s failure to obtain a proper transfer permit, as well as concerns about Asha’s missing left tusk. The ranch’s owner, Patricia Zerbini, said she told FWC that the elephant lost the tusk by its own doing in August.FWC inspected Two Tails three days after the filing and found “no welfare concerns,” according to an agency report dated Oct. 18. The report did not recommend any disciplinary action against the ranch or Zerbini, and dismissed FACE’s request for Asha’s seizure.Born in the African Savanna biome, Asha spent 40 years at the privately owned Natural Bridge Zoo in Virginia. FACE and other animal rights groups had hoped she would be moved to a sanctuary when the zoo was raided in December as part of an animal cruelty investigation.That investigation led to the seizure of about 100 animals from the zoo, according to news reports. Rockbridge County, Virginia, gained custody of 71 of them after a six-day jury trial, that state’s attorney general’s office announced in March.Robin Vitulle, a cofounder and co-president of FACE, which is based in Satellite Beach, said Asha should have been among those seized. But on Dec. 1, five days before the Natural Bridge raid, Asha was sent to Two Tails, arriving early the next day, according to a letter to FWC from Mark Wilson, a veterinarian from Sumter County.In his letter, Wilson cited veterinary and previous dental concerns as the reason for transferring Asha, but he did not note any illnesses or injuries after evaluating the elephant on her first day at Two Tails. Wilson also in the letter expressed his “dismay” regarding FWC’s accessibility and responsiveness – and suggested he was among the few veterinarians “qualified” to treat Asha.According to a FWC incident report dated Feb. 13, Zerbini told an investigator, Kenneth Holmes, that she had all of the proper documentation, that she had been talking with Natural Bridge since 2019 about transferring Asha to Two Tails, and that she had asked Wilson to obtain the import permit. She also told Holmes that Wilson told her he had the permit, the report states.In the report, the investigator wrote: “I advised P. Zerbini again about the failure to obtain an approved import permit prior to ASHA coming to her facility. She reiterated that M. Wilson told her he got the permit. I advised her that since the elephant was transported using her equipment and came to her facility, she should have done due diligence and asked for the permit. In addition, the permit should have accompanied the elephant while in transit.”“I don’t have anything to hide,” Zerbini told WUFT News. Referring to Asha, the ranch owner said: “She is here legally. She’s here, for now, permanently.”In March, FWC issued Wilson a warning violation for not obtaining the required permit. Wilson did not respond to several texts, calls and voicemails from WUFT News seeking comment.Asha’s status and the missing tuskTwo Tails Ranch is 104-acre boarding facility that has housed over 300 Asian and African elephants since its founding in 1984, according to Zerbini. In addition to guided private tours offering opportunities to take photos with, feed and ride the elephants, Two Tails also rents out elephants for circuses, weddings, fairs and parades.Asha, who goes by Asia at the ranch, does not give rides and lives in a separate paddock away from people and the four Asian elephants also on the property.Photos taken by WUFT News on Sept. 7 show Asha was missing her left tusk, despite having it as recently as June 18, according to according to footage from Cardinal News, a Virginia-based news site. Vitulle said the missing tusk was a major concern, and her group’s documentation of it “escalated and solidified” what she said was their “alarming concern” for her health and welfare. Asha, an African elephant at the center of controversy involving FWC and animal rights groups, waits as a staff member at Two Tails Ranch in Williston brings her a bale of grass. (Grace McClung/WUFT News) “What happened to her? Where is the tusk?” Vitulle asked. “It raises eyebrows.”Zerbini said Asha broke her tusk off while playing in her enclosure at night on Aug. 27.“It’s",4800,True,0

Florida Police Arrest Potential Teen Serial Killer Who Stabbed Victim 45 Times,https://www.crimeonline.com/2024/11/02/florida-police-arrest-potential-teen-serial-killer-who-stabbed-victim-45-times/,2024-11-02,"Search for: Close Search Florida Police Arrest Potential Teen Serial Killer Who Stabbed Victim 45 Times Florida law enforcement believes the man they arrested had the potential to become a serial killer based on the random violent acts he committed or attempted, according to News Nation. In Port St. Lucie on Wednesday, Omarion Ivory, 18, was served with an arrest warrant for killing Francis Gennacem, 67. Ivory was served with an arrest warrant in St. Lucie County Jail due to a previous arrest on September 20. After not showing up for work for a few days, Gennacem’s coworkers called for a welfare check. When police arrived at his home on September 12, they found Gennacem dead. Gennacem had been stabbed approximately 45 times and had wounds to his head and neck, according to the arrest report. A 4-inch blade was found next to the body. On September 8, Gennacem was alone at his Southeast Albatross Avenue home cooking when he answered the door to a violent random attack. Police believe Gennacem was hit in the head with a hammer and then stabbed to death, with his body left inside the front door, according to WPBF. “You have to draw some conclusions based on the forensics and the position of the recovered body in the crime scene,” said Port St. Lucie Police Department Acting Chief Leo Niemczyk. “I suspect that when (Gennacem) opened the door, he got hit with the hammer. I think (Ivory) entered, closed the door, and then stabbed him to death.” On September 20, Ivory was found approximately 5 miles from Gennacem’s home at a lone woman’s home on Southeast Lavirna Circle. News Nation reports that Ivory was banging on the door and looking through the woman’s windows. He was armed with the bloody hammer that was used on Gennacem a few days prior. Ivory tried to flee on his bicycle but was taken into custody. “All accounts lead us to believe that Mr. Ivory was probably preparing to commit a second homicide that day,” Niemczyk said in a news conference. “A second random act and a second person not known to him.” The chief added, “We may have had an undetected serial killer in the works.” The detectives established a connection between the crimes committed approximately five miles apart. They examined the clothing and shoes of the suspect, identified the stolen bicycle he was caught using, and reviewed neighborhood surveillance recordings. After Ivory’s arrest, the hammer and knife were analyzed, and the blood found on the hammer was confirmed to be Gennacem’s. The knife used to stab Gennacem and left next to his body had Ivory’s fingerprints. Investigators also confirmed Ivory’s shoe size and patterns matched those at the crime scenes. The charges against Ivory include first-degree premeditated murder, armed burglary, loitering and prowling, possession of tools for burglary, burglary itself, and grand theft.

He fled on a bicycle before he was taken into custody. Detectives linked the crimes, which occurred roughly five miles apart. They compared the suspect's clothing and shoes, bicycle -- which was discovered to be stolen -- and neighborhood surveillance footage. ""All accounts lead us to believe that Mr. Ivory was probably preparing to commit a second homicide that day,"" Assistant Police Chief Leo Niemczyk said in a news conference. ""A second random act and a second person not known to him."" ""We may have had an undetected serial killer in the works,"" the chief added. Officials said Ivory did not know either of his targets personally, and there is no known motive. When detectives seized the weapons, blood found on the hammer was confirmed to be Gennace's. The knife found next to Gennace's body had Ivory's fingerprints, and his shoe size and shoe patterns matched those at the crime scenes, according to police. Police believe he acted alone. The chief said he has a juvenile arrest history, and his family claimed he has a history of paranoid schizophrenia, but that is not officially confirmed. Ivory is facing charges of first-degree premeditated murder, armed burglary, loitering and prowling, possession of burglary tools, burglary and grand theft.

Why police say this man could've become a serial killer if not caught - WFLX,https://www.wflx.com/2024/10/31/why-police-say-this-man-couldve-become-serial-killer-if-not-caught/,2024-10-31,"Skip to contentA man who police said could have become a serial killer is now under arrest for the killing of a 67-year-old Port St. Lucie man last month.Omarion Ivory, 18, is facing charges of first-degree premeditated murder and armed burglary of a dwelling committing battery in the Sept. 8 death of Francis Gennace at his home in the 1000 block of Southeast Albatross Avenue.Gennace’s body, however, wasn’t found until four days later, on Sept. 12, when his employer called police after Gennace hadn’t shown up for work in a few days.At a news conference Thursday, Assistant Police Chief Leo Niemczyk of the Port St. Lucie Police Department said Ivory — who didn’t know Gennace — knocked on the victim’s door on Sept. 8.When Gennace answered, Niemczyk said Ivory hit the 67-year-old with a hammer, then stabbed him to death.“The victim had blunt force trauma to the head and multiple stab wounds. Approximately 45 stab wounds,” Niemczyk said. “Our theory is that he uses [the hammer] to knock the victim out unconscious, then he stabs him.” from Albatross Avenue connected the dots and saw Ivory attempting to break into another home elsewhere in the city.Police quickly responded to that address and took Ivory into custody. He still had the hammer used in Gennace’s killing, Niemczyk said.Niemczyk added that Gennace’s murder was completely random, and police believe that Ivory was preparing to commit a second homicide on a second random victim when he was captured on Sept. 20.“We may have had an undetected serial killer in the works,” Niemczyk said. “This is highly unusual for us. We haven’t seen a lot of these in Port St. Lucie. It was quite concerning.”Niemczyk added that the hammer in Ivory’s possession still had Gennace’s blood on it.“From September 12th to September 20th, this person was roaming the city free?” WFLX News journalist Tyler Hatfield asked Niemczyk at Thursday’s news conference.“Correct. That’s why this is so alarming,” Niemczyk answered, adding that there were no additional homicides in Port St. Lucie during that time frame.According to Niemczyk, Ivory’s family said he has paranoid schizophrenia and has been Baker Acted multiple times in the past, meaning he’s had to undergo a mandatory mental health evaluation when he was believed to be a danger to himself or others.In addition to first-degree murder and armed burglary, Ivory is facing other charges, including burglary of an unoccupied dwelling, grand theft, possession of burglary tools, and loitering or prowling.

Previously known for detecting explosives and tuberculosis, these rodents are proving to be versatile allies in conservation efforts. “Our study shows that we can train African giant pouched rats to detect illegally trafficked wildlife, even when it has been concealed among other substances,” said lead author Isabelle Szott, a researcher at the Okeanos Foundation. “The rats also continued to detect the wildlife targets after not encountering that species for a long period,” added co-author Kate Webb, an assistant professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University.The study was conducted at APOPO, a non-profit organization based in Tanzania that develops low-tech, cost-effective solutions to humanitarian challenges.Rats in the fight against wildlife traffickingTo prepare for the detection tasks, the rats – Kirsty, Marty, Attenborough, Irwin, Betty, Teddy, Ivory, Ebony, Desmond, Thoreau, and Fossey (many named after renowned conservationists) – underwent a series of training stages. Each rat learned to recognize specific wildlife scents through what researchers called “indication training,” where the rats held their noses over a scented target for a few seconds. A correct response was rewarded with flavored rodent pellets, motivating them to repeat the behavior.As their training progressed, the rats were introduced to various non-target scents such as electric cables, coffee beans, and washing powder – substances often used by traffickers to mask wildlife scents. “During the discrimination stage, rats learn to only signal the odors of the wildlife targets while ignoring non-targets,” Szott explained.The study demonstrated the rats’ impressive retention abilities. After periods of five and eight months without exposure to the target scents, the rats could still recognize them with perfect retention scores, a level of cognitive retention comparable to that of trained dogs. By the end of the training program, eight rats successfully identified four wildlife species from 146 other substances commonly found in shipping cargo.Rats are a practical solution “Existing screening tools are expensive and time intensive, and there is an urgent need to increase cargo screening.

Translations may contain inaccuracies—please refer to the original content. 🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur. While enormous rats might be many people's nightmare, these huge rodents could be a key weapon in the battle against the trading of illegal wildlife goods. African giant pouched rats can be trained to sniff out trafficked wildlife products, ranging from rhino horns and elephant ivory to pangolin scales and African blackwood, according to a new paper in the journal Frontiers in Conservation Science. The crafty rodents have especially keen noses, having been previously trained to detect landmines and the bacteria that cause tuberculosis. ""Our study shows that we can train African giant pouched rats to detect illegally trafficked wildlife, even when it has been concealed among other substances,"" said study co-author Isabelle Szott, a researcher at the Okeanos Foundation. In the paper, the researchers describe how they trained 8 of a cohort of 11 rats—named Kirsty, Marty, Attenborough, Irwin, Betty, Teddy, Ivory, Ebony, Desmond, Thoreau, and Fossey—how to successfully detect these substances. ""The illegal wildlife trade (IWT) is one of the largest global crime economies, directly threatening species and their habitats, and biodiversity, and indirectly the global climate, and countries' economies,"" the researchers wrote in the paper. Through Tanzania-based not-for-profit organization APOPO, the researchers first introduced the rodents to the smell of pangolin scales, which are one of the world's most widely trafficked animals. The rats were trained to poke their nose into a hole containing a substance, and rewarded when they performed the ""nose poke"" when a target scent was present. The rats were then introduced to non-target scents including coffee beans, washing powder, and electric cables, which are often used by traffickers to mask the scent of the illegal goods. ""During the discrimination stage, rats learn to only signal the odors of the wildlife targets, while ignoring non-targets,"" Szott said. Even months after being trained on a certain scent, the rats were still able to remember the scent to the same degree as dogs. ""The rats also continued to detect the wildlife targets after not encountering that species for a long period,"" co-author Kate Webb, an assistant professor at Duke University, said in the statement. According to the paper, 8 of the 11 rats were able to identify pangolin scales, elephant ivory, rhino horn, and African blackwood among 146 non-target substances. These rats' ability to successfully sniff out wildlife good amongst an array of other smells means that they could be an extremely valuable asset in the battle against poaching and trafficking. The World Wildlife Crime Report by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) found earlier this year that ""wildlife trafficking overall has not been substantially reduced over two decades,"" with around 4,000 species being illegally traded between 2015 and 2021. Of these species, 3,250 are listed in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).

Nigeria's last elephants – what must be done to save them - The Conversation,https://theconversation.com/nigerias-last-elephants-what-must-be-done-to-save-them-240464,2024-10-30,"African forest elephant. Godong/Getty Images Nigeria has a unique elephant population, made up of both forest-dwelling (Loxodonta cyclotis) and savanna-dwelling (Loxodonta africana) elephant species. But the animals are facing unprecedented threats to their survival. In about 30 years, Nigeria’s elephant population has crashed from an estimated 1,200-1,500 to an estimated 300-400 today. About 200-300 are forest elephants and 100 savanna elephants. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recently classified the forest elephant as “critically endangered” and the savanna elephant as “endangered”. The country has never had herds in the multiple thousands, but its elephants have played a vital ecological role, balancing natural ecosystems. Today they live primarily in protected areas and in small forest fragments where they are increasingly isolated and vulnerable to extinction. They are found in Chad Basin National Park in Borno State and Yankari Game Reserve in Bauchi State. Also in Omo Forests Reserve in Ogun State, Okomu National Park in Edo State and Cross River National Park in Cross River State. Elephants in Nigeria are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, poaching and illegal ivory trade, human-elephant conflict and climate change. These issues are pushing them to the brink of extinction. In August 2024 Nigeria launched the country’s first National Elephant Action Plan. The 10-year strategic plan aims to ensure the long-term survival of elephants in Nigeria. But will it? As a conservationist with research in elephant conservation, I think this plan is a promising initiative. It could ensure the survival of Nigeria’s elephants. However, the long-term sustainability of the elephant populations in Nigeria depends on how well the plan balances conservation efforts with economic development. The government must also be willing to support the plan. It must commit financial resources to carry out the plan. Here I set out the threats to elephants in Nigeria and four urgent steps needed to save these animals. Taking these steps will help make the strategic plan a reality. Threats to elephants in Nigeria Expansion of agriculture, urbanisation and infrastructure development leads to habitat loss and fragmentation. The destruction of elephant habitats means that populations are isolated. This has made it difficult for the animal to migrate, find food and breed. At about 3.5% a year, the rate of forest loss in Nigeria is among the highest globally. Poaching of elephants for their ivory and traditional medicinal value is another menace. Despite the ivory trade ban under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, Nigeria-linked ivory seizures amounted to 12,211kg in the period 2015-2017. In January 2024, Nigeria destroyed 2.5 tonnes of seized elephant tusks valued at over 9.9 billion naira (US$11.2 million). Human-elephant conflict is a growing challenge. As elephants lose their habitats, they encroach on farmland, leading to conflicts with people. Elephants damage crops. In retaliation, some communities harm or kill the elephants. Climate change is another threat to the survival of elephants in the country. Water scarcity and food insecurity affect both humans and elephants. Elephants are forced to venture into human-dominated landscapes, increasing conflicts. : Nigeria risks losing all its forest elephants – what we found when we went looking for them Saving endangered elephants in Nigeria To save its elephants, Nigeria needs to take the",3536,True,0

Employing them in the field could increase pressure on wildlife smugglers and add a flexibly deployable tool to screen cargo, the researchers said. In the past, African giant pouched rats have learned to detect explosives and the tuberculosis-causing pathogen. Now, a team of researchers have trained these rats to pick up the scent of pangolin scales, elephant ivory, rhino horn, and African blackwood. These animals and plants are listed as threatened and at high danger of extinction. “Our study shows that we can train African giant pouched rats to detect illegally trafficked wildlife, even when it has been concealed among other substances,” said Dr Isabelle Szott, a researcher at the Okeanos Foundation, and first co-author of the study published in Frontiers in Conservation Science. , delivering breaking science news straight to your inbox every day. “The rats also continued to detect the wildlife targets after not encountering that species for a long period,” added first co-author Dr Kate Webb, an assistant professor at Duke University. The research for the present study was conducted at APOPO, a Tanzania-based, non-profit organization that provides a low-tech, cost-efficient solutions to pressing humanitarian challenges. The rats – Kirsty, Marty, Attenborough, Irwin, Betty, Teddy, Ivory, Ebony, Desmond, Thoreau, and Fossey; some of them named after conversationalists and advocates against wildlife trafficking – underwent several training stages. During indication training, the rats learned to hold their noses for several seconds in a hole in which the target scent was placed. When they correctly performed this ‘nose poke’ they were rewarded with flavored rodent pellets. In the next step, the rats were introduced to non-target odors. These included electric cables, coffee beans, and washing powder – objects that are frequently used to mask the scent of wildlife in real-life trafficking operations. “During the discrimination stage, rats learn to only signal the odors of the wildlife targets, while ignoring non-targets,” Szott said. The rats were also trained to remember smells. At the end of their retention training, they were re-introduced to scents they’d not encountered for five and eight months, respectively. Despite months of non-exposure, the rats showed perfect retention scores, suggesting that their cognitive retention performance resembles that of dogs. By the end of the training, eight rats were able to identify four commonly smuggled wildlife species among 146 non-target substances. “Existing screening tools are expensive and time intensive and there is an urgent need to increase cargo screening. APOPO's rats are cost-efficient scent detection tools. They can easily access tight spaces",3106,True,0

Although these animals are found primarily in Africa and Asia, many agencies think the ramifications of ivory poaching are felt around the world. The United States only adopted a near-total ban in 2016. Despite the bans on commercial trading, ivory is still legal to possess in the U.S., and many people still do. “Toss the Tusk,” an event organized by The Association of Zoos and Aquariums’ Wildlife Trafficking Alliance and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, aims to educate the American public on the severity of ivory poaching and illegal ivory trade at zoos across the United States. “The challenges with ivory are mostly that for centuries, ivory has been commercially traded.

INTEL FROM THE IVORY TOWER: Did the Inflation Reduction Act WorK?,https://pagosadailypost.com/2024/10/28/intel-from-the-ivory-tower-did-the-inflation-reduction-act-work/,2024-10-28,"The economy in general, and inflation in particular, have been listed as key election issues for 2024. I decided to test whether the Inflation Reduction Act, the signature economic legislation from the Biden Administration, helped reduce inflation or not. I make the data available in this column since I know that’s important for people. President Biden signed The Inflation Reduction Act into law on August 16, 2022. So I compare the time period before the Inflation Reduction Act was passed (September 2020 to August 2022) to the time after the IRA was passed (September 2022 to October 2024). If you believe that it should count two minutes after a bill is signed, instead of two weeks, I can’t help you there. When Trump was president in the second half of 2020, prices were low (inflation was less than two percent), because fewer people were buying. We were also in the middle of a falling stock market and one of our worst quarters of gross domestic product in American history, so businesses slashed prices to get anyone to buy. Once the economy perked up with the vaccine being available during the change in administration, we ran into supply chain issues, as demand outstripped supply, which is why the global inflation rate rose, just as high as it did in the U.S. Economics 101 will tell you that with low supply and high demand, prices will rise. Sure enough from September 2020 to August of 2022, the average inflation rate was 5.346%. It got as high as 9.1 percent in June of 2022. That’s what led to this: “Former U.S. President Donald Trump claimed during the September 10, 2024, presidential debate with Vice President Kamala Harris that inflation was the worst it’s ever been under President Joe Biden.” Snopes rated this claim false. I checked for myself, and Trump is wrong. The Annual CPI for both 2021 and 2022 do not even make the top ten for Annual CPI cases just since 1929 (see Investopedia data for this). That doesn’t even count cases before Herbert Hoover took office. By November of 2022, inflation fell from 8.2 percent to 7.1 percent. By February of 2023, inflation was down to six percent. By April of 2023, it was below five percent. By June of 2023, it was three percent. In September of 2024, the inflation rate was 2.4 percent. The average inflation rate after passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was 4.256. I ran a difference of means test and found it was significantly lower than before the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law. You can run the numbers yourself from Statista too, if you’d",2550,True,0

Cocoa prices on Thursday extended their week-long selloff, with NY cocoa dropping to a 7-3/4 month nearest-futures low and London cocoa falling to a 2-week low. Harvest pressures in the Ivory Coast are undercutting cocoa prices. Monday's government data showed that Ivory Coast farmers shipped 192,804 MT of cocoa to ports from October 1 to October 20, up +12.9% from 170,794 MT shipped the same time last year. The Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa producer. Cocoa prices are also weighed down by negative carryover from last Friday when Ivory Coast regulator Le Conseil Cafe-Cacao raised its Ivory Coast 2024/25 cocoa production estimate to 2.1 MMT to 2.2 MMT from a June forecast of 2.0 MMT. Recent global cocoa demand news has been mixed. Last Thursday, the National Confectioners Association reported that North American Q3 cocoa grindings rose +12% y/y to 109,264 MT. Also, the Cocoa Association of Asia reported that Q3 Asian cocoa grinding rose +2.6% y/y to 216,998 MT. However, the European Cocoa Association reported that European Q3 cocoa grindings fell -3.3% y/y to 354,335 MT. Shrinking global cocoa stockpiles are bullish for prices. ICE-monitored cocoa inventories held in US ports have been trending lower for the past 17 months and fell to a 15-year low Thursday of 1,833,436 bags. Cocoa found support after Ghana's Cocoa Board (Cocobod) on August 20 cut its 2024/25 Ghana cocoa production estimate to 650,000 MT from a June forecast of 700,000 MT. Due to bad weather and crop disease, Ghana's 2023/24 coca harvest sank to a 23-year low of 425,000 MT. Ghana is the world's second-biggest cocoa producer, and its 2024/25 cocoa harvest begins in October. An increase in cocoa production by Cameroon, the world's fifth-largest cocoa producer, is bearish for cocoa prices. On August 21, Cameroon's National Cocoa and Coffee Board reported that in 2023/24 (Aug/July), Cameroon cocoa production rose +1.2% y/y to 266,725. Also, Nigeria's August cocoa exports rose by +6.8% y/y to 14,984 MT. Nigeria is the world's sixth-largest cocoa producer. In a bullish factor, the International Cocoa Association (ICCO) on August 30 raised its 2023/24 global cocoa deficit estimate to -462,000 MT from May's -439,000 MT, the largest deficit in over 60 years. ICCO also cut its 2023/24 cocoa production estimate to 4.330 MMT from May's 4.461 MMT. ICCO projected a 2023/24 global cocoa stocks/grindings ratio of a 46-year low of 27.4%.

Exclusive: Ivory Coast cocoa farmers remain concerned over comparatively low crop payments,https://www.confectioneryproduction.com/news/50064/exclusive-ivory-coast-cocoa-farmers-remain-concerned-over-comparatively-low-crop-payments/,,"Exclusive: Ivory Coast cocoa farmers remain concerned over comparatively low crop paymentsPosted 24 October, 2024 Share on Facebook Share on LinkedIn Share on X cocoa farming in West Africa (pic Olam)The Ivory Coast has released the latest prices to be paid to cocoa farmers in the region that have prompted concerns from within the industry that has sparked concern from market observers that rates remain significantly below global and neighbouring country prices, writes Neill Barston.According to official government communications, farming co-operatives will now be paid $3.2 per kg (equivalent to $3,200 per tonne), for the main season crops, and a minimum of $3.03 per kg for individual farm gate prices. This stands against commodities prices being achieved in New York and London markets of at least $7,000 per tonne this month – with prices having peaked earlier this April at $12,000 a tonne.As previously reported by Confectionery Production, the existing model of cocoa sales for the region has been on the basis of advance sales, with cocoa in the main, being traded a year ahead of production, which is at the core of the commodities trading platforms operation.However, for many market observers, including in the view of farmer unions in West Africa, this has created an imbalance in the system, where commodities traders stand to gain major profits in an upward market cycle as has been the case, with farmers seeing a far lesser share of those inflated values (gaining around a fifth of those prices) in many instances within Ghana and Ivory Coast.Consequently, as previously reported, the comparatively low pay to farmers in both Ivory Coast and Ghana (which was raised earlier this summer in the wake of major price spikes, but still far below international commodities values), has led to a persistent problem of cocoa smuggling to neighbouring African countries where cocoa has commanded higher prices.Ange-Laurent Gnagne, of the Ivory Coast Cocoa Cooperative (Scoopega-Scoops), noted that pricing disparity between prices attained by Ivory Coast farmers was of significant concern, as the issue remains at the heart of agricultural communities being able to earn a living income.He said: “Clearly, the current pricing gap between Ivory Coast and the world is a problem to most of the farmers in Ivory Coast. We do not understand why Ivory Coast and Ghana have not been able to raise their prices significantly, while the current rise on prices on the international market allows it.”As previously reported, many farmers within the region remain on wages well below $2 a day, less than globally defined poverty levels, meaning they have been unable save and invest into many agricultural inputs including fertilisers and",2743,True,0

The ivory trade is a multi-billion dollar underground business. Finally, the three biggest elephant ivory dealers have been discovered, writes ""Der Spiegel"". Ivory is the hard bony substance of elephant tusks, which is used to make valuable decorative items. They are highly sought after by industrialized countries and this has led many poor people in Africa to kill elephants to carry out a trade that captures billions of euros. Illegal cartels export ivory mainly from elephants in Mombasa (Kenya), Entebbe (Uganda) and Lome (Togo). As the DNA data has proven, the ivories were initially exported from different countries, while from 2011 to 2014 most of them came from the three aforementioned cartels, reports albinfo.ch. Otherwise, since 1989, the trade in ivory has been banned, because it brings great damage to the world of elephants, however this has remained only on paper. From 2006 to 2015, the number of elephants in Africa has decreased by 111 thousand - this is due to illegal hunting. Now there are about 415 thousand elephants living in Africa, most of them in southern Africa. About 50 thousand elephants live in Asia.

The deaths have now been taken up by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) after local animal lovers and activists expressed their frustration over the lack of accountability. Senior lawyer Bhabani Satpathy has filed a case with the NGT, alleging that the Forest Department’s negligence has led to these tragic incidents. Satpathy said, ""The department has failed to provide satisfactory explanations for the deaths."" He pointed out that one elephant calf, rescued from Deogaon in August, died after three days due to medical negligence, with a blockage in its esophagus. Another elephant was found dead with missing tusks, and a third reportedly died from electrocution, though the exact circumstances remain unclear. ""I demand an investigation into the deaths and accountability from the Forest Department, which is ill-prepared to handle such situations,"" said Satpathy. He emphasized that the rise in elephant deaths and human-elephant conflicts in Balangir is alarming, with both sides suffering losses. This is not the first time Satpathy has fought for elephant protection. In the 1990s, he successfully campaigned for the release of the Kharsel elephant, which had been kept in iron chains for years, eventually leading to its rehabilitation in the Debrigarh forest. Kharsel however died in September 2024.It is important to note that a baby elephant was killed in a train collision near Rourkela despite warnings issued to the railway authorities beforehand about movement of a herd in the area. The accident occurred allegedly due to a miscommunication between the railways and the forest department, leading to the collision. Another elephant injured in the accident was sent to Nandankanan Zoo in Bhubaneswar, with no major injuries reported.As many as 1,357 elephants have died across the country in the last 14 years, a Right to Information application had revealed a year back in September 2023. Of these, 898 elephants have been killed by electrocution, 228 due to hit by a train, and 191 by poachers. Alarmingly, as many as 40 elephants have been poisoned to death, the RTI reply revealed. RTI activist Hemant Gonia, resident of Haldwani, Uttarakhand, said that in the month of June, he had sought information from the Central Public Information Officer in the Prime Minister's Office.Gonia said that the way elephants are suddenly dying in the country, questions are being raised on the functioning of the Forest Department given the heavy spending on the conservation budget. Gonia suggested that the Union Forest Environment Ministry needs to make special efforts for the protection, conservation and promotion of elephants.Union Minister of State for Environment, Forest, and Climate Change, Ashwini Kumar Choubey, recently informed the Lok Sabha that India has an estimated population of 29,964 wild elephants, based on a 2017 estimate.

According to media reports from the neighbouring country Sithembile Khumalo (37) of Plumtree, in Matabeleland South province, was caught by police officers with a single tusk at Nswazwi Mall near a fast-food outlet on June 29, 2024. Indications are that she was in the company of her nephew, Gilbert Tasiiwa, when she was arrested. Tasiiwa was later discharged as he knew nothing about the tusk. It was the State’s case that police officers pounced on the pair and searched their bag in which they found a 12,5kg sack of maize meal containing one whitish object wrapped with three different cloths. Khumalo then told the police it was her tusk and that she got it in Plumtree. The tusk was taken to the Bureau of Standards and it weighed 5,3kg.

Elephant Skull Excavated In Kashmir Identified As Extinct 'Straight-Tusked' Species Elephant Skull Excavated In Kashmir Identified As Extinct 'Straight-Tusked' Species An elephant skull discovered in Kashmir 24 years ago has been identified as belonging to the extinct ""straight-tusked"" Palaeoloxodon species, one of the largest elephant species ever to roam the Earth. Discovered in 2000 in Pampore, this skull is unique because it differs from other specimens found in India. Its features closely resemble a skull found in Turkmenistan, suggesting that it may represent a distinct species previously unknown to researchers. Typically, elephants have curved tusks, but the straight-tusked Palaeoloxodon, which lived in Europe and Western Asia, had large tusks that lived up to its name. This species, which survived until about 21,000 years ago, was among the largest land mammals, standing around four meters tall and weighing between 9-10 tonnes. Despite its extinction, the discovery of the skull in Kashmir offers crucial insights into its evolutionary history. The Kashmir skull was uncovered alongside 87 prehistoric stone tools, which were re-examined in 2019 by an international team of researchers, including scientists from the University of Jammu. Their goal was to study the species' taxonomy, investigate its cause of death, and assess any human involvement in its demise. The findings, published in *Quaternary Science Reviews*, revealed that the skull belonged to a Palaeoloxodon elephant, but with some key anatomical differences from other Indian Palaeoloxodon skulls. Most notably, the Kashmir skull ""thickened, forward-projecting crest at the skull roof"" that is commonly found in other specimens from India. Instead, it exhibited distinct characteristics similar to a skull that was recovered in Turkmenistan during the 1950s, which had been classified as a separate species known as Palaeoloxodon turkmenicus.

However, because of its difference from other skull specimens of the same species found in India and similarity to one recovered from Turkmenistan, the skull could “represent a distinct species that we previously knew very little about”, said lead author Advait Jukar, currently at the Florida Museum of Natural History, the US. While an elephant’s tusks are usually known to be curved, the straight-tusked elephant is an extinct species found in Europe and Western Asia, and it survived until at least 21,000 years ago, according to the Natural History Museum, the UK. The Kashmir skull was buried with 87 stone tools used by prehistoric humans, all of which were re-examined in March 2019 by the international team of researchers, including those from the University of Jammu. They wanted to determine the species’ taxonomy (category), cause of death and if humans were involved in any way. The findings from the re-examination are  -- about the same estimated age as the Turkmen skull. This supported the belief that the two skulls from Kashmir and Turkmen represent a species distinct from other Eurasian Palaeoloxodon, they said.",1371,True,0

During the first controlled purchase in October 2022, Ivory sold over 111 grams of methamphetamine and 98 fentanyl pills for $3,800. In January 2023, Ivory sold 282 fentanyl pills for $1,950. In March 2023, Ivory sold over 276 grams of methamphetamine and 487 fentanyl pills for $5,000.In February 2023, officials seized over $55,000 in cash that Ivory attempted to transport from Anchorage to Fort Wayne, Indiana, on a commercial flight. Ivory attempted to smuggle the cash by hiding it inside three tennis shoes in a checked bag. The cash had trace amounts of methamphetamine, cocaine and fentanyl on it. Later that month, officials also seized over 180 fentanyl pills from a co-conspirator during a traffic stop. Investigators uncovered text messages from Ivory directing the co-conspirator to hide the fentanyl pills from police.On June 22, 2023, officials simultaneously executed search warrants for two residences associated with Ivory, one of which was Ivory’s primary address. At 6:30 a.m., agents announced their presence outside Ivory’s residence. Ivory and a co-defendant did not come outside and surrender until 7:00 a.m. Upon searching the residence, agents recovered over $18,000 in U.S. currency, a money counter, drug packaging material, over 160 fentanyl pills, some of which were partially dissolved and scattered in a toilet bowl, two firearms and ammunition.In April and May 2023, law enforcement seized three additional packages, each containing",2187,True,0

Excavated in Kashmir 24 years ago elephant skull found to be of extinct 'straight-tusked' species,https://www.theweek.in/wire-updates/national/2024/10/16/lst2-research-elephant-species.html,2024-10-16,"New Delhi, Oct 16 (PTI) An elephant skull that researchers unearthed from Kashmir's Pampore town in the year 2000 belonged to a ""straight-tusked"" Palaeoloxodon species, one of the largest known elephant species that ever lived, according to a study. However, because of its difference from other skull specimens of the same species found in India and similarity to one recovered from Turkmenistan, the skull could ""represent a distinct species that we previously knew very little about,"" said lead author Advait Jukar, currently at the Florida Museum of Natural History, US. While an elephant's tusks are usually known to be curved, the straight-tusked elephant is an extinct species found in Europe and Western Asia, and it survived until at least 21,000 years ago, according to the Natural History Museum, UK. The Kashmir skull was buried with 87 stone tools used by prehistoric humans, all of which were re-examined in March 2019 by the international team of researchers, including those from the University of Jammu. They wanted to determine the species' taxonomy (category), cause of death and if humans were involved in any way. The findings from the re-examination are  -- about the same estimated age as the Turkmen skull. This supported the belief that the two skulls from Kashmir and Turkmen represent a species distinct from other Eurasian Palaeoloxodon, they said.

Kenya relocates elephants to avoid conflict with humans - Prensa Latina,https://www.plenglish.com/news/2024/10/15/kenya-relocates-elephants-to-avoid-conflict-with-humans/,2024-10-15,"Nairobi, Oct 15 (Prensa Latina) Kenyan wildlife specialists are proceeding at full steam today with the removal of fifty elephants living in the Mwea National Reserve (center), in an attempt to quell complaints from the local residents about the animals. October 15, 2024 15:18 The pachyderms, which know neither limits nor manners, look for their food wherever they can, sometimes in plantations, wreaking great havoc in the local farmers’ crops and, still worse, affecting market supplies. With this move the local authorities manage to avoid unpredictable clashes between humans and animals, while simultaneously protecting the food supply and bringing a fresh attraction to the Aberdare National Park (center), the new residence of the evacuees and a jewel of the Kenyan tourism industry, which relies on safaris as an income lifeline for the country. The growing elephant population in Kenya is translating into the ravaging of the remaining grazing lands by these humongous mammals and into aggravating clashes between them and locals, Kenya’s Minister of Tourism and Wildlife, Rebeca Milano, admitted earlier this month, as she advocated the animals’ relocation. On the bright side, however, such an increase in their number shows the effectiveness of the anti-poachers’ campaigns,",1288,True,0

While they were still at the mall, police officers confronted them and searched the blue bag, in which they found a 12.5 kg sack of maize meal containing one whitish object wrapped in three different cloths.Khumalo told the police that it was her tusk, claiming she had found it in Plumtree and had asked her nephew to assist her in carrying it.The tusk was taken to the Bureau of Standards, where it was found to weigh 5.3 kg. Khumalo pleaded for leniency, stating that she is a first-time offender.“I am asking for forgiveness; this is my first time clashing with the law, and I will never do it again,” she pleaded.Her request for leniency was dismissed, and she was fined P20,000 and sentenced to four years in prison.

Nigeria to boycott AFCON qualifier against Libya after players claim they were left stranded ... - CNN,https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2024/10/14/sport/nigeria-stranded-libya-airport-spt-intl,2024-10-14,"CNN — The Nigeria men’s soccer team is back home after being stuck at a remote Libyan airport for over 15 hours, according to Nigeria’s football governing body and team captain William Troost-Ekong. The Super Eagles are scheduled to play against host Libya in a 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier in the city of Benghazi on Tuesday, but the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) has stated the players have decided not to play the match. In an Instagram post, the NFF said that the squad was stranded overnight at Al Abraq airport outside of Al Bayda, Libya. It had originally been set to land over 200 kilometers (roughly 124 miles) away in Benghazi. “The chartered ValueJet aircraft was, strangely and in a dangerous manner, diverted to the small airport away from Benghazi just as the pilot was completing his approach to the Benghazi Airport,” said the NFF. “We understand the Al Abraq International Airport is only used for hajj operations. “Fatigued players and officials have remained nonplussed as the host Libyan Football Federation (LFF) failed to send any reception team or even vehicles to take the delegation members from the airport to their hotel, said to be 3 hours away in Benghazi.” The NFF added that transport had been organized for the team but was no longer in place due to the flight’s diversion. According to Reuters, the LFF said that it has “utmost respect for our Nigerian counterparts” and claimed that the flight diversion was not intentional. “We firmly reject any claims that suggest foul play or sabotage in this situation,” the LFF said. “We hope that this misunderstanding can be resolved with understanding and goodwill.” Last week, the NFF released a statement rejecting claims of poor treatment in Nigeria made by Libya captain Faisal Al-Badri and insisted that the LFF “created chaos for its own team.” CNN has reached out to the LFF and NFF for comment. On Monday, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) issued a statement noting the governing body had been in touch with both national teams and “had been informed that the Nigerian National Football Team (‘’Super Eagles’’) and their technical team were stranded in disturbing conditions for several hours at an airport that they were allegedly instructed to land by the Libyan authorities.” The statement concluded, “The matter has been referred to the CAF Disciplinary Board for investigation and appropriate action will be taken against those who violated the CAF Statutes and Regulations.” Troost-Ekong said on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the situation had been brought about as a result of “mind games.” “12+ hours in an abandoned airport in (Libya) after our plane was diverted whilst descending,” he wrote early Monday. “(Libyan) government rescinded our approved landing in Benghazi with no reason.

Mongkol Chaiyaphakdee, head of Kaeng Krachan National Park, reported that the elephant was spotted by a patrol team in the Huai Sat Yai Subdistrict of Hua Hin District. PRACHUAP KHIRI KHAN, Thailand –– Rangers at Kaeng Krachan National Park have discovered a rare five-year-old wild baby elephant with tusks measuring 60 centimeters—almost five times the length of an average elephant of the same age, October 11. Mongkol Chaiyaphakdee, head of Kaeng Krachan National Park, reported that the elephant was spotted by a patrol team in the Huai Sat Yai Subdistrict of Hua Hin District. The park’s surveillance cameras captured the footage, revealing a male calf with unusually long and beautiful tusks. Typically, a five-year-old elephant’s tusks would only measure around 10-15 centimeters. The herd of elephants, including this unique calf, is still roaming within the park and has not ventured into nearby villages. The Kaeng Krachan Park’s elephant monitoring center is closely tracking the herd to prevent human-wildlife conflicts, in line with policies from Natural Resources and Environment Minister Varawut Silpa-archa and directives from Atthapol Charoenchansa, Director-General of the Department of National Parks, Wildlife, and Plant Conservation. Kaeng Krachan National Park is one of Thailand’s most important habitats for wild elephants, home to around 300-350 elephants. The park’s rich biodiversity, abundant food sources, and water make it an ideal environment for wild elephants. However, the expansion of local communities and farmlands surrounding the park poses ongoing challenges in managing the elephants’ habitat and minimizing conflicts between humans and elephants.

The Many Faces of the Kingdom of Shu - Archaeology Magazine - November/December 2024,https://archaeology.org/issues/november-december-2024/features/the-many-faces-of-the-kingdom-of-shu/,,"Skip to content A one-foot-wide bronze mask dating to around 1100 b.c. emerges from beneath a bronze vessel containing cowrie shells during recent excavations at the site of Sanxingdui in China’s Sichuan Province. For much of China’s millennia-long history, the western region of Sichuan was geographically isolated, encircled by mountains and with only limited connections to the outside world via the Yangtze River and its tributaries. The Bronze Age people of Sichuan were long thought to have been peripheral to the rise of that era’s two great powers, the Shang Dynasty (ca. 1600–1046 b.c.) and the Zhou Dynasty (1046–256 b.c.). These two states held sway over China’s Central Plains to the east of Sichuan along the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River. “Sichuan was left out of the grand narrative of the origins of Chinese history,” says archaeologist Rowan Flad of Harvard University. The fourth-century a.d. Chronicles of Huayang, the oldest surviving Chinese geographical survey, records that Sichuan was once the domain of the Kingdom of Shu. According to these chronicles, one Shu king, who is described as having bulging eyes, taught his people how to cultivate silkworms, while another had the ability to communicate with fish. For thousands of years, the Kingdom of Shu was known only through such semilegendary accounts. Then, in 1927, a father and son dug a ditch at the site of three earthen mounds near the banks of the Yazi River in central Sichuan, 25 miles northeast of present-day Chengdu. They found that the mounds, known locally as Sanxingdui, or “three-star mounds,” concealed hundreds of jade artifacts, including ceremonial tablets and scepters. Archaeologists who excavated the site soon thereafter discovered that the mounds were, in fact, remnants of a wall that surrounded a Bronze Age city that had existed around the same time as the Shang Dynasty. Perhaps, they thought, Sanxingdui had been the capital of the elusive Kingdom of Shu. In the 1980s, workers from a nearby brick factory stumbled upon",2042,True,0

Diallo, who has made six appearances for his country, has since returned to Manchester ahead of the Red Devils' upcoming Premier League fixture against Brentford.The 22-year-old earned his first cap for the Elephants in 2021, and was recalled to Emerse Fae's group after a 15-month absence in June for wins over Zambia and Chad.Ivory Coast know that two wins against the Leone Stars will seal their progression to the tournament, which takes place in Morocco at the end of next year.

Argentina's Alejandro Garnacho, England's Kobbie Mainoo and Morocco's Noussair Mazraoui are the other players left out as a precaution. Diallo has made 10 appearances for United this season in all competitions, scoring once in his side's 2-1 defeat to Brighton at the start of the 2024-25 campaign.

Look At The Elephants Of Mozambique - IFLScience,https://www.iflscience.com/want-modern-proof-of-evolution-look-at-the-elephants-of-mozambique-76266,2024-10-08,"Evolution is often portrayed as an achingly long process, taking generations upon generations of small changes accumulating over a timeline too long to appreciate in a single, puny human lifetime. In certain extreme circumstances, however, it’s possible to see the impacts of natural selection in just a few years – for example, throughout the 1980s in central Mozambique, ivory poaching acted as a potent evolutionary pressure that saw a dramatic rise of female African elephants born without tusks. The spell of rapid evolution was kicked into hyperdrive by the Mozambican Civil War, a brutal conflict between 1977 and 1992 that led to an estimated death toll of around 1 million people and devastated the region’s biodiversity. In the Gorongosa National Park, located in the heart of the country, the number of large herbivores – including elephants, hippopotamuses, buffalo, zebra, and wildebeest – declined by over 90 percent during the period of bloodshed. The destruction of habitat and the breakdown of conservation projects played a role in their demise, but intense poaching was arguably the prime factor. Both the government forces (FRELIMO) and the anti-communist rebels (RENAMO) prolifically hunted the country’s elephants to obtain ivory, a valuable resource that could be sold on the black market to fund their cause. An angry-looking Elephant without tusks at Gorongosa National Park in Mozambique. Image credit: Walter Mario Stein/Shutterstock.com The conflict lasted 15 years, but it left a lasting imprint on the Gorongosa elephant population. A 2021 study published in the journal Science found that the frequency of tuskless females had risen from 52 elephants (18.5 percent of the total population) in the pre-war period to 108 (50.9 percent of the population) in the post-war period. Using statistical analysis, the researchers were able to show that this rise in tusklessness was the direct result of intense poaching. Simply put: the tuskless elephants were",1982,True,0

Long-lost Shipwreck Loaded With Gold Worth $13 Million Found In African Dessert,https://www.marineinsight.com/shipping-news/long-lost-shipwreck-loaded-with-gold-worth-13-million-found-in-african-dessert/,2024-10-07,"Skip to content Image for representation purposes only Diamond miners in Namibia have discovered the wreckage of a Portuguese ship with treasure worth $13 million, making it one of the most incredible shipwreck recoveries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The ship Bom Jesus (The Good Jesus) went missing in 1533 after being trapped in a strong storm. Miners working for the diamond company De Beers recovered it. The Bom Jesus sailed from Lisbon, heading to India, before disappearing without a trace. During a regular mining operation on Namibia’s coast, workers drained a man-made lagoon and discovered the wreck preserved in the desert sands. Among the items retrieved were thousands of gold coins, bronze cannons, copper ingots, over 50 elephant tusks, swords, and muskets. Dr. Dieter Noli, chief archaeologist at the Southern Africa Institute of Maritime Archaeological Research, has long expected such a discovery. Per the sources familiar with the issue, Noli had advised miners for over a decade to keep an eye out for shipwrecks in the area, believing that one would eventually resurface. The excavation took over a week, with the treasure chest filled with gold coins found on the sixth day. Experts believe the ship’s copper ingots were essential in preserving numerous artefacts because they resisted marine creatures that usually consume shipwrecks. Per the maritime archaeologists, this enabled the extraordinary preservation of objects that would otherwise have deteriorated over 500 years. The treasure contained nearly 2,000 Spanish and Portuguese gold coins, Portuguese silver coins, navigational tools, and other items. The discovery has gathered a lot of attention, with reports stating that the copper and other materials played an important part in keeping the ship intact for centuries. Despite the vessel’s age, only a small portion of its structure remained due to extensive damage from the ocean. While the final journey of the Bom Jesus remains unknown, experts believe it capsized after being pulled too close to shore by a violent storm, causing its hull to hit a rock. The coastline where the ship was discovered is known for its extreme weather conditions, such as violent storms and dense fog. Over time, the sea decreased, leaving the wreckage in desert sand. De Beers and its mining team found the treasure but did not claim ownership of it. The Namibian government kept all of the recovered items, as is standard procedure when a wreck is discovered on national grounds. According to reports, Portugal might have legally seized the ship, which was classified as a “ship of state” since it belonged to the King of Portugal. However, in a kind move, the Portuguese government gave up its rights, allowing Namibia to keep the entire discovery. Reference: DunyaNews, Indy100 Do you have info to share with us ?

Beginning with A Room with a View, combined with my two other favorites, Howard’s End and The Remains of the Day, these timeless masterpieces immersed me in an exquisite world of Edwardian drama. Helmed by the brilliant quartet of American James Ivory as screenwriter and director, Indian-born Ismail Merchant, novelist and screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, and composer Richard Robbins, I now realize how incredibly we were spoiled at that time by their historical masterpieces.What made the movies from Merchant Ivory Production so intoxicating for me? I don’t think I’m the only one who couldn’t get enough of the kind of wondrous detail to history, brought to life with stunning cinematography (who could forget those walks among the bluebells in Howard’s End?), sumptuous settings (that unforgettable Quisisana e Ponte Vecchio square in A Room with a View), emotional honesty, beautifully detailed costumes (all the lace that Dame Emma Thompson dons in Howard’s End), nuanced writing, swooning music (Remains of the Day’s haunting soundtrack) and of course those fascinatingly complex characters. You have all that brilliance along with some of the best actors that have ever lived to bring these intricate worlds to life. Thompson not only starred alongside Sir Anthony Hopkins in Howard’s End, but they brought to the screen one of the most devastating relationships I’ve ever seen play in theaters, in the heartbreaking Remains of the Day. Merchant Ivory’s prestigious productions also included the late Dame Maggie Smith, Dame Judi Dench, Helena Bonham Carter of course, Hugh Grant, Vanessa Redgrave, the late Julian Sands, Simon Callow, Daniel Day-Lewis, Rupert Graves, Christopher Reeves, and even a young Lena Headey (way before Game of Thrones). It would have been impossible to cast these film gems any better.So when my local art house theater (the historic Jane Pickens) was putting on a mini-Merchant Ivory festival, I of course jumped at the chance. I’m sad to say that I missed the showing of A Room with a View, the magnificent love letter to Italy, because of a conflict. This was the film that broke ground for Merchant Ivory and for historic art films in general. When it arrived in 1985, it caused a sensation. A tale of an independent-minded Edwardian woman (Bonham Carter) who is torn between her family-approved engagement to the priggish, intellectual Cecil Vyse (Day-Lewis) and her love for the free-spirited romantic George Emerson (Sands, in what would be his most captivating role), it’s the cinematic atmosphere that draws you in. The lush scenery of Italy and the compellingly detailed characters proved intoxicating to audiences, with A Room with a View breaking ground for art house cinema. I know people who have stayed in that very square in Florence just because of that film. Next on the agenda was Howard’s End, which took Cannes and Oscars by storm when it came out in 1992.

The discovery was made by Lund University in Lund, Sweden. Vikings traded with the Arctic natives of Greenland several centuries before Christopher Columbus arrived in America. The discovery was made byLund University in Sweden, which examined the ancient DNA of a walrus to arrive at these conclusions.An international research team led by the Swedish university traced the trade routes of Viking-era walrus ivory, finding that Vikings and indigenous Arctic peoples probably met and traded ivory in remote areas of the High Arctic. The study is now published in Science Advances.In medieval Europe, there was a huge demand for high-level products, includingwalrus ivory. The Vikings played a key role in the ivory trade, and this pushed the Norse expansion into the North Atlantic as far as Iceland and then Greenland, just to look for new sources of ivory.“What really surprised us,” said Peter Jordan, professor of archaeology at Lund University, “was that much of the walrus ivory exported to Europe came from very remote hunting grounds located deep in the High Arctic. Previously, it was always thought that the Norse simply hunted walruses near their main settlements in southwestern Greenland.”The researchers used genetic “fingerprinting” to accurately reconstruct the provenance of commercialized walrus artifacts. “We extracted ancient DNA from walrus samples recovered from a wide range of locations in the North Atlantic Arctic,” explains Morten Tange Olsen, associate professor at the Globe Institute in Copenhagen. “With this information in hand, we were able to match the genetic profiles of traded walrus artifacts to specific Arctic hunting grounds.”As the new findings emerged, another fundamental question arose: if ivory was mined from the High Arctic, did Greenlanders have the seafaring skills and technology to venture so deep into the icy waters of the Arctic?

EPA-DAI KUROKAWA Nairobi, Oct 4 (EFE).- The Kenya Wildlife Service has started the relocation of 50 elephants from an animal reserve to a national park in an effort to improve coexistence between humans and wildlife. The tuskers were moved from the Mwea National Reserve to the Aberdare National Park, both located in central Kenya. “Kenya’s growing population is encroaching on the elephants’ remaining pastures, exacerbating the conflict,” Tourism and Wildlife Minister Rebeca Milano said in a statement reported by local media on Friday. The relocation, which took place on Thursday, is in response to an increase in the number of elephants in Mwea, rising from 49 to 159 since 1979. This surge has led to property damage and intensified conflicts between humans and elephants. “Translocation is essential to protect the welfare of both the elephants and the surrounding communities,” the wildlife service said. [FILE] Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta (R) and the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) Chair Richard Leaky (L) stand in front of a pile of elephant tusks before it was set ablaze during an ivory burning event at the Nairobi National Park in Nairobi, Kenya, 30 April 2016. EFE-EPA/FILE/DAI KUROKAWA The agency argued that this measure would alleviate pressure on the Mwea ecosystem and bolster the elephant population in Aberdare National Park, promoting ecological balance. Cecily Mbarire, the governor of Embu County, where Mwea National Reserve is located, praised the initiative, stating it would not only reduce elephant numbers but also improve the livelihoods of local communities. She also highlighted plans to re-enrich the under-exploited natural habitat of Mwea National Reserve. The KWS noted that increasing the number of elephants in Aberdare would enhance ecotourism, generating economic benefits and supporting sustainable development. The transportation of these animals is part of the KWS plan on modern conservation techniques, community involvement, and technology integration. The goal is to create thriving animal populations, protected habitats, and harmonious coexistence between humans and wildlife. Between 1979 and 1989, Kenya experienced an “alarming decline” in its elephant population due to poaching for ivory, which reduced the number from 170,000 to just 16,000, according to the KWS. “Extensive conservation efforts have helped reverse this decline.

Trophy hunting is decimating super tuskers on the Kenya-Tanzania border - ISS Africa,https://issafrica.org/iss-today/trophy-hunting-is-decimating-super-tuskers-on-the-kenya-tanzania-border,,"Trophy hunting is decimating super tuskers on the Kenya-Tanzania border Despite an agreement between Kenya and Tanzania prohibiting borderland hunting, Tanzania has allowed the hunting of bull elephants to expand. Published on 04 October 2024 in ISS Today By Valtino Omolo Research Officer, ENACT, ISS Nairobi Willis Okumu Senior Researcher, ENACT, ISS Nairobi Despite their declining numbers, super tuskers – bull elephants with tusks weighing over 45 kg each – are being slaughtered by international sport hunters in the Amboseli ecosystem, which stretches along the Kenya-Tanzania border. This hunting is licensed by Tanzania, despite a 1995 agreement between the two countries prohibiting borderland hunting after four Amboseli elephants were killed in 1994. Fewer than 30 super tuskers remain worldwide, with only 10 left in the Amboseli ecosystem. This means super tuskers are on the brink of extinction both regionally and globally. Their vulnerability to extinction is exacerbated by the fact that they are often killed in their prime reproductive years. Males aged 40-54, known to have the largest tusks, have the highest reproductive success. In March this year, Joseph Ole Lenku, Governor of Kenya’s Kajiado County, raised concerns over three super tuskers killed within the Amboseli ecosystem. Five have also reportedly been killed so far this year in Tanzania’s Enduimet area, around 40 km from the Kenya-Tanzania border. The elephants were part of a 2 000-strong herd that traverse Kenya’s Amboseli National Park and Tanzania’s Enduimet Conservation Area. Elephant movements from the Amboseli Conservancy into the Enduimet area, Kenya-Tanzania border Source: Africa Geographic, 2024 According to Big Life Foundation Executive Chair Richard Bonham and Dr Paula Kahumbu, Chief Executive of WildlifeDirect, these borderland jumbos frequently cross the Kenya-Tanzania border to forage for food, exposing them to conflicting conservation jurisdictions. Trophy hunting in Tanzania is governed by clearly outlined regulations. The Tanzania Wildlife Management Authority specifies that hunting is permitted only between 1 July and 31 December. The regulations also highlight that hunters need to present proof of their kill afterwards, in the form of skin, hooves and other non-edible animal parts. Trophy hunters in Tanzania reportedly pay between US$10 000 and $20 000 to hunt super tuskers. Although the government issues these permits, many licensed hunters do not adhere to the regulations that control the permits, leading to their misuse. The most recent super tusker killings show a clear violation of Tanzania’s hunting regulations. Not only were the elephants hunted outside the permitted hunting period, but their carcasses were intentionally burnt beyond identification. These breaches point to non-compliance and inadequate regulation oversight, casting doubt on trophy hunting transparency. Fewer than 30 super tuskers remain worldwide – with only 10 left in the Amboseli ecosystem Regulations have been flouted since the lifting of a ban on hunting for trophies and bush meat in 2018. The ban was initially imposed in 2015 to halt the abuse of hunting permits. In 2022, Tanzania’s Tourism Minister Damas Ndumbaro travelled to Las Vegas to market the country’s hunting safaris to wealthy American tourists and other trophy-hunting investors. Both actions have allowed for the expansion of trophy hunting in Tanzania, notwithstanding concerns over non-compliance with the regulations. The recent incidents have also raised concerns about a resurgence of criminal activity in the trophy-hunting industry. Of particular concern is the potential role of criminal syndicates in the wildlife sector, as was the case in 2018 when Tanzania’s trophy hunting industry was implicated in wildlife trafficking. This mainly involved ‘pseudo-hunting’ – using trophy hunting to cover up illegal activities such as wildlife trafficking or poaching. At the time, trophy hunts served as a ruse for acquiring and exporting valuable parts of protected animals for illegal trade. Former tourism minister Hamisi Kigwangalla accused hunting operators of being involved in poaching, illegally exporting ivory and having ties to the now-arrested ‘Ivory Queen’, Yang Fenglan. But the involvement of government officials in this illegal trade also highlighted the role of corruption in the wildlife sector. While trophy hunting has economic benefits for Tanzania, pseudo-hunting has many negative consequences While trophy hunting has economic benefits for Tanzania, pseudo-hunting has many negative consequences. The Tanzanian government and relevant stakeholders must take decisive action to protect the region’s rich biodiversity. This is especially critical given that Tanzania lost 60% of its elephants in just five years leading up to 2014, though their numbers have since partially recovered. Comprehensive reforms are urgently needed to enhance transparency and accountability in wildlife and conservation efforts. Tanzania could draw from the good practices implemented by regional neighbours, South Africa, Kenya and Zimbabwe. Kenya’s stringent wildlife protection laws and its use of monitoring technology demonstrate the importance of a strong legal framework and real-time data access. Zimbabwe’s quota system emphasises the value of scientifically determined quotas and species-specific protections. And South Africa advocates for ‘sustainable hunting practices’ that seek to protect elephants within reproductive ages. Together, these approaches ensure sustainable hunting practices and protect endangered species. Cross-border elephants provide immense socio-ecological value to the Amboseli and Enduimet ecosystems The implementation of independent oversight mechanisms is also crucial. Zimbabwe’s Parks and Wildlife Management Authority and the Kenya Wildlife Service provide effective models for monitoring and enforcing regulations. By adopting such approaches, countries can ensure that conservation efforts are transparent and effective, leading to better wildlife protection and",6093,True,0

In an earlier interview, Ritah Namisango, the university’s principal communications officer, said that the exterior had been restored to its original grandeur. However, interior changes were made to reflect modern designs and safety standards. The traditional wooden floors have been replaced with tiles and terrazzo, as wood was considered a contributing factor to the spread of the fire.

She wasn’t happy about it. “I had three days of my summer holidays left and I didn’t want to waste it,” Manisha says, laughing. But there was one small consolation: she’d be seated next to someone else her age—the groom’s teenage son, Christopher Toh. They spoke for hours that night “about everything and nothing,” Manisha says. Yet he didn’t ask for her number. At first, Manisha thought maybe she misread the signs. But as she went to board her flight to Melbourne two days later, she got a random text: “He had hunted my number down through a friend of a friend of a friend,” she says. “I tried desperately to come up with a crafty reply, but the nerves took over, so I gave up and called him instead. We spoke until my plane took off.” It turns out she never needed to worry: “It was love at first sight,” says Chris. Fifteen years later, Chris proposed to Manisha over dinner at home in Singapore. She knew it was coming. “I had a sneaking suspicion he might propose because he was just so enthused about this dinner,” she says. Over the next four hours, Chris served Manisha an elaborate menu where each of the eight courses symbolized a moment in their life together.

Retracing walrus ivory trade of Viking Age reveals early interactions between Europeans ...,https://phys.org/news/2024-09-retracing-walrus-ivory-viking-age.html,2024-09-30,"By examining ancient walrus DNA, an international research team led by Lund University in Sweden have retraced the walrus ivory trade routes of the Viking Age. They found that Norse Vikings and Arctic Indigenous peoples were probably meeting and trading ivory in remote parts of High Arctic Greenland, several centuries before Christopher Columbus ""discovered"" North America. The study is now published in Science Advances. In Medieval Europe, there was an enormous demand for elite products, among them—walrus ivory. With the Vikings playing a vital part in the ivory trade, this drove the Norse expansion into the north Atlantic to Iceland and then Greenland; as they looked for new sources of ivory. ""What really surprised us was that much of the walrus ivory exported back to Europe was originating in very remote hunting grounds located deep into the High Arctic. Previously, it has always been assumed that the Norse simply hunted walrus close to their main settlements in southwest Greenland,"" says Peter Jordan, Professor of Archaeology at Lund University. The researchers used genetic ""fingerprinting"" to reconstruct precisely where traded walrus artifacts were coming from. ""We extracted ancient DNA from walrus samples recovered from a wide range of locations across the North Atlantic Arctic. With this information in place, we could then match the genetic profiles of walrus artifacts traded by Greenland Norse into Europe back to very specific Arctic hunting grounds,"" explains Dr. Morten Tange Olsen, Associate Professor at the Globe Institute in Copenhagen. As the new results started to emerge, another key question arose: if ivory was being obtained from the High Arctic, did the Greenland Norse have the seafaring skills and technologies to venture so deep into ice-filled Arctic waters? Research team member Greer Jarrett sought answers to this question in a unique way: he actually reconstructed probable sailing routes, taking experimental voyages in traditional clinker-built Norwegian boats. ""Walrus hunters probably departed from the Norse settlements as soon as the sea ice retreated. Those aiming for the far north had a very tight seasonal window within which to travel up the coast, hunt walrus, process and store the hides and ivory onboard their vessels, and return home before the seas froze again,"" says Greer Jarrett, doctoral researcher at Lund University. After the Norse completed their perilous journeys, what might they have encountered? Importantly, these remote High Arctic hunting grounds were no empty polar wilderness; they would have been inhabited by the Thule Inuit and possibly other Indigenous Arctic peoples, who were also hunting walrus and other sea mammals. The new research provides further independent evidence for the long-debated existence of very early encounters between the European Norse and North American Indigenous peoples, it also confirms that the North Water Polynya was an important arena for these inter-cultural meetings. ""This would have been the meeting of two entirely different cultural worlds. The Greenland Norse had European facial features, were probably bearded, dressed in woolen clothes, and were sailing in plank-built vessels; they harvested walrus at haul out sites with iron-tipped lances,"" says Jordan. In contrast, the Thule Inuit were Arctic-adapted specialists, and used sophisticated toggling harpoons that enabled them to hunt walrus in open waters. They would have been wearing warm and insulated fur clothing and would have had",3520,True,0

However, greater collaboration at the landscape level beyond single supply chains is needed. Hence, the CFI strategy focuses on landscape-level programming in areas prioritised, as a result of high levels of historic deforestation, that are also critical for cocoa production in both countries.Country progress Within Ivory Coast, the initiative highlighted the Classified Forest of Cavally, one of six CFI priority landscapes, has been upgraded to a nature reserve, enhancing its conservation status. Collaboration in this landscape has expanded with new partners, including Touton and CocoaSource, joining Nestlé and Earthworm. In the Yapo-Abbé and Bossématié landscapes work has begun on comprehensive land-use assessments, stakeholder engagement and baseline studies. These will lead to investment plans that will be finalised by the end of 2024.Meanwhile, in Ghana, within the Asunafo-Asutifi landscape, progress has been made and stakeholders have jointly defined and agreed on a comprehensive landscape management plan. Efforts are underway to secure additional investments to scale and accelerate implementation.pic: ofiRegarding climate mitigation measures, the scheme noted that Ivory Coast is actively developing carbon policies aligned with the UNFCCC National Determined Contributions. Ghana received its second results-based payment of nearly $5 million from the World Bank’s Emission Reduction Programme, with the largest share going to CREMAs (Community Resource Management Area) and farmer groups. This ensures that farmers and farming communities are leading and owning key interventions, which is essential for ongoing sustainability.These, in turn are linked to the CFI’s community engagement and social inclusion, through which in Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire a total of 12,361 Village Savings and Loans Associations (VSLA) were supported. In both countries, CFI signatories distributed 10 million multi-purpose tree seedlings to cocoa producers to support increased carbon stocks and biodiversity through agroforestry.Laurent Tchagba, Minister of Water and Forests, Ivory Coast, commented: “Two of CFI’s initial major challenges are now effectively addressed. One is the operationalisation of the national unified cocoa traceability system, and the other is the operationalisation of the national spatial forest monitoring and deforestation early warning system. These two instruments are necessary to meet the requirements of the EUDR.”Chris Vincent, WCF President commented “These achievements underscore the power of collaboration in driving sustainable change. The progress made in forest conservation and climate adaptation is a testament to the commitment of all stakeholders involved in the Cocoa & Forests Initiative.”Speaking in the foreword to the report, he added: “Signatory companies continued their CFI",3922,True,0

Zimbabwe feels impact of ivory trade ban as stockpiles surge to 130 tonnes - ZimLive,https://www.zimlive.com/zimbabwe-feels-ivory-trade-ban-impact-as-stockpiles-surge-to-130-tonnes/,2024-09-29,"News, Top Stories Zimbabwe feels impact of ivory trade ban as stockpiles surge to 130 tonnes Ivory worth over US$600 million is lying idle at Zimparks vault in Harare - parks boss Stockpiles… tonnes of elephant tusks continue to rise in government vaults with no prospects of any economic gain on them HARARE – The global ban on ivory trade has left the country burdened with over 130 tonnes stockpiles of the tusks, the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (Zimparks) has said. The controversial ban was imposed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) in 1989 and over 130 tonnes of ivory worth over US$600 million is lying idle at Zimparks’ vault in Harare. Speaking on the sidelines of a signing ceremony with Defend, formerly National Park Rescue (NPR) in Chizarira National Park in Binga recently, Zimparks director general Fulton Mangwanya said stock quantities continue to rise. The painful part., said the Zimparks boss, was that the country cannot derive any economic value from it. “Because of natural mortality, because of maybe management of elephants, they (stockpiles) continue to rise,” Mangwanya said. “The situation that I have right now is that the vault on its own is now full of ivory. I don’t know what to do with it.” The problem is not helped either by the ever-increasing elephant population in Zimbabwe, host to one of the world’s largest herd of the jumbo. The country has over 80,000 elephants with its biggest game reserve, Hwange National Park carrying between 45,000 and 55,000 elephants against a carrying capacity of 15,000. Due to reservations, Zimbabwe last culled elephants in 1988 but authorities now plan to kill 200 elephants saying they want to feed hunger-stricken communities surrounding game parks. Mangwanya said there has been criticism over this decision but vowed there is no turning back on it. “Right now, we are doing it internally. We want to kill, utilise the meat; we are not exploiting, they still make noise…you send them (elephants) to China, they make noise. You say we want to sell the hides, they make noise,” he said of conservationists. “You want to sell the ivory, they make noise. So, by the end of the day as a sovereign state we have to do what is good for our nation. “We will not watch and see our people dying of hunger, especially those surrounding the parks where we have got these elephants. “So indeed yes, we are going to kill 200 or even",2453,True,0
Early Interactions Between Europeans And Indigenous North Americans Revealed,https://www.eurasiareview.com/30092024-early-interactions-between-europeans-and-indigenous-north-americans-revealed/,2024-09-29,"Norse transported “packages” of ivory back to Europe (with tusks attached to skull). Mikkel Høegh-Post 1 Entertainment Europe The Americas September 30, 2024September 30, 2024 Eurasia Review 0 Comments By Eurasia Review By examining ancient walrus DNA, an international research team led by Lund University in Sweden have retraced the walrus ivory trade routes of the Viking Age. They found that Norse Vikings and Arctic Indigenous peoples were probably meeting and trading ivory in remote parts of High Arctic Greenland, several centuries before Christopher Columbus “discovered” North America. The study is now published in Science Advances. In Medieval Europe, there was an enormous demand for elite products, among them – walrus ivory. With the Vikings playing a vital part in the ivory trade, this drove the Norse expansion into the north Atlantic to Iceland and then Greenland; as they looked for new sources of ivory. “What really surprised us was that much of the walrus ivory exported back to Europe was originating in very remote hunting grounds located deep into the High Arctic. Previously, it has always been assumed that the Norse simply hunted walrus close to their main settlements in southwest Greenland”, says Peter Jordan, Professor of Archaeology at Lund University. The researchers used genetic “fingerprinting” to reconstruct precisely where traded walrus artefacts were coming from. “We extracted ancient DNA from walrus samples recovered from a wide range of locations across the North Atlantic Arctic. With this information in place, we could then match the genetic profiles of walrus artefacts traded by Greenland Norse into Europe back to very specific Arctic hunting grounds”, explains Dr. Morten Tange Olsen, Associate Professor the Globe Institute in Copenhagen. As the new results started to emerge, another key question arose: if ivory was being obtained from the High Arctic, did the Greenland Norse have the seafaring skills and technologies to venture so deep into ice-filled Arctic waters? Research team member Greer Jarrett sought answers to this question in a unique way: he actually reconstructed probable sailing routes, taking experimental voyages in traditional clinker-built Norwegian boats. “Walrus hunters probably departed from the Norse settlements as soon as the sea ice retreated. Those aiming for the far north had a very tight seasonal window within which to travel up the coast, hunt walrus, process and store the hides and ivory onboard their vessels, and return home before the seas froze again.”, says Greer Jarrett, doctoral researcher at Lund University. After the Norse completed their perilous journeys, what might they have encountered? Importantly, these remote High Arctic hunting grounds were no empty polar wilderness; they would have been inhabited by the Thule Inuit and possibly other Indigenous Arctic peoples, who were also hunting walrus and other sea mammals. The new research provides further independent evidence for the long-debated existence of very early encounters between the European Norse and North American Indigenous peoples, it also confirms that the North Water Polynya was an important arena for these inter-cultural meetings. “This would have been the meeting of two entirely different cultural worlds. The Greenland Norse had European facial features, were probably bearded, dressed in woollen clothes, and were sailing in plank-built vessels; they harvested walrus at haul out sites with iron-tipped lances”, says Peter Jordan. In contrast, the Thule Inuit were Arctic-adapted specialists, and used sophisticated toggling harpoons that enabled them to hunt walrus in open waters.

"Ivory from Vandalur zoo was stolen three years ago, prime accused still at large",https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2024/Sep/29/ivory-from-vandalur-zoo-was-stolen-three-years-ago-prime-accused-still-at-large,2024-09-29,"CHENNAI: The two pieces of elephant tusks that went missing from the ivory stockpile of Vandalur zoo were reportedly stolen almost three years ago, according to wildlife officials.The theft allegedly took place in 2021-22, and it was an insider job. This was disclosed by Parthiban, an ex-zoo worker, and the fifth accused arrested in connection with the ivory theft by authorities a few days back. In a confession statement, Parthiban reportedly said that he along with Satish alias Appu, the prime accused in the case who is still at large, stole two pieces of tusks nearly three years back while carrying out painting works, sources told TNIE. Because the two tusks weighed just 1.1 kg, and there were over 1,200 tusk pieces weighing 1.83 tonnes in total in the ivory stockpile, the theft went undetected all these years, a zoo official said. However, questions are being raised about the quality of bookkeeping and periodical enumeration of ivory stock. “If proper periodical ivory stock enumeration was carried out, the theft would have been detected long back,” another official said.Vandalur Zoo is currently in the process of destroying the entire stock by December 2. Recently, zoo director Ashish Kumar Srivastva and chief wildlife warden Srinivas R Reddy appeared before Madras high court and informed there was difficulty in destroying the stock, citing a ban from the centre.

Tanzania High Court frees man sentenced to 20 years for possession of elephant tusks,https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/tanzania/news/court-news/tanzania-high-court-frees-man-sentenced-to-20-years-for-possession-of-elephant-tusks-4779624,2024-09-29,"Arusha. The Shinyanga Sub-Registry of the High Court of Tanzania has released Peter Ndekeja, who had been serving a 20-year prison sentence for possession of two full elephant tusks and seven pieces of ivory, valued at $30,000. The court overturned the conviction after identifying legal irregularities in the case. Peter, who was originally sentenced by the Meatu District Court in Economic Crime Case No. 9 of 2023, was ordered to be freed. Among the errors cited was the lower court’s failure to properly record witness testimony, which prevented the High Court from fully understanding the evidence presented. Additionally, the search conducted during the investigation violated Section 40 of the Criminal Procedure Act (CPA), rendering the evidence obtained inadmissible. Another key issue was the lack of a proper seal on the certificate and authorization from the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), which allowed the case to proceed in the lower court. This irregularity was acknowledged by the state attorney during the appeal. The ruling was delivered on September 27, 2024, by Justice Ruth Massam, who presided over Criminal Appeal No. 22200 of 2024. After hearing arguments from both the defense and prosecution, the court ruled in favor of Peter’s release due to the significant legal errors in the trial process. Case background Peter was initially charged in the Meatu District Court with possession of government trophies, specifically two complete elephant tusks and seven pieces of ivory. The value of the tusks was estimated at $30,000. This was a violation of Section 86(1) and (2)(b) of the Wildlife Conservation Act, along with the Economic and Organized Crime Control Act (EOCCA). He was accused of possessing the illegal items on April 29, 2023, in Sakasaka Village, Meatu District, Simiyu Region. After a full trial, Peter was found guilty and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Appeal During the appeal, Peter, represented by lawyer Sululu, raised two main issues: first, that the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, and second, that the magistrate lacked authority to hear the case, as the DPP’s certificate and authorization were improperly issued. State attorney Saguya Goodluck represented the prosecution in the appeal. Lawyer Sululu focused on the second argument, stating that the DPP’s certificate, while issued, was not properly sealed, violating established legal procedures. Citing prior rulings by the Court of Appeal, Sululu argued that the lack of a properly sealed certificate invalidated the trial and called for Peter’s immediate release. The lawyer also requested that the case not be retried, as doing so would allow the prosecution to correct its mistakes, especially regarding the improper identification of the ivory. In response, the state attorney conceded that the certificate was not sealed and admitted that several procedural errors had occurred during the trial, including the illegal search and failure to properly record evidence. Ruling Justice Massam, after reviewing the submissions and the lower court records, agreed with the arguments presented by both the defense and the prosecution. She confirmed that the failure to properly seal the DPP’s certificate, combined with other significant legal errors, was enough to invalidate the entire trial. The judge also agreed that the search was conducted unlawfully, violating Section 40 of the CPA, as it took place without a warrant. Citing Section 388 of the CPA, Justice Massam ruled that the legal errors were serious enough to nullify the conviction and sentence. She ordered Peter’s immediate release. Observers say the move reflects a strategic shift within CCM to modernise its internal governance and respond to growing public expectations for transparency and meritocracy.

"Migrating Herd of 100 Elephants Bring a Message of Hope, Beauty, and Coexistence to NYC",https://www.printmag.com/culturally-related-design/great-elephant-migration-public-art-new-york-city/,2024-09-26,"Skip to content If you’ve wandered through the Meatpacking District recently, you might have encountered a herd of unexpected visitors in the heart of Manhattan. Once a district known for the heavy footsteps of cattle headed to slaughter, and the clatter of Louboutins headed to Pastis, New York City’s Meatpacking District is now home to a very different kind of animal gathering. The cobblestone streets are filled with life-size elephant sculptures, each one part of “The Great Elephant Migration,” an immersive public art installation on view until October 20. This exhibition features 100 handcrafted sculptures, each modeled after a real, living elephant from the Nilgiri Hills of Southern India. Created by Indigenous artisans using strips of lantana camara—an invasive shrub harmful to local wildlife habitats—the sculptures stretch across a vast 12,000 square feet of plazas and walkways. The majestic elephants’ migration to downtown Manhattan has brought with them intricate beauty and a message of hope and conservation. Photo by Mark Warner courtesy of the Great Elephant Migration. Co-organized by the nonprofit Art&Newport and conservation group Elephant Family USA, the installation aims to raise awareness and funds for endangered elephants and wildlife around the world. What makes these sculptures so unique is that they aren’t just static displays; they invite interaction, and visitors are encouraged to touch and feel the detailed craftsmanship. Whether it’s the lifelike resin eyes, wooden tusks, or the individual personality reflected in each piece’s pose and structure, these elephants offer a tactile connection to nature—right in the heart of the city. Dodie Kazanjian, founder of Art&Newport, explained to the New York Times that the installation mimics “how it is when you’re in India, with the elephants walking through the streets”. And while these weatherproofed sculptures may be motionless, the emotional response they evoke in passersby is anything but still.

Ruth Ganesh, a trustee of Elephant Family USA, highlights the deeper mission: “We’re trying to recreate that feeling of awe, wonder, and connection.”",2243,True,0

Mahout Dies in Attack at Bali Safari Park,https://www.balidiscovery.com/mahout-dies-in-attack-at-bali-safari-park/,2024-09-25,"A Mahout working at the Bali Safari and Marine Park suffered a tragic death on Tuesday, 17 September 2024, in an encounter with one of the Park’s elephants that had temporarily run amok. Widely reported across major media in Bali, Komang Resi Yasa (27), a young man from a transmigrant Balinese family in Lampung, South Sumatra, died at around 9:00 am on Tuesday, 17 September, when he was savagely attacked by Gandi – a 30-year-old captive bull elephant housed at the Park renowned for its nature conservancy programs. Authorites Respond to Attack Scene Scene of the Elephany Attack Eyewitness accounts of the accident relate that another Park worker, Suwoko (38), was sitting atop Gandi when the animal, in a sudden burst of aggression, traveled a distance estimated at only 10 meters before attacking Komang Resi Yasa Suwoko said that the elephant that was feeding in the tall grass at the time of the attack is usually calm and relaxed when involved in the feeding process. With bystanders screaming for the Mahout to run for his life, the unfortunate young man fell into the tall elephant grass at the location. The elephant then used its tusks to toss the man into the air repeatedly. Those who witnessed the incident estimated that Gandi boosted the man into the air around ten times. Komang Working as a Mahout at Bali Safari Komang Resi Yasa in Happier Times in Bali Meanwhile, Suwoko, sitting atop the out-of-control elephant, tried in vain to subdue and stop the attack using a “ganco” – a small sharp pick-axe often employed by handlers to control elephants. Also, trying to divert the attention away from the hapless victim, another man who works at the Park, Gilang Romadhon, repeatedly poked the elephant with a long pole. In desperation, Romadhon then tried to employ several nearby female elephants to draw Gandi away from the prolonged attack on his now motionless victim. Separately, an unnamed expert in Bali’s captive elephant attraction sector speculated that the sudden behavioral change in the elephant may be linked to “Musth” – a periodic condition experienced by all male elephants during which they experience a large rise in reproductive hormones that often results in temporary spats of aggressive behavior. When the attack ended, Komang Resi Yasa had suffered wounds to his thigh, left shoulder, and chest. The man was quickly evacuated to the nearby Kasih Ibu Hospital in Saba, Ginayar, where he was pronounced “dead on arrival.” The fatal incident is now under formal investigation by the Gianyar Police Precinct.

I now investigate the track record of the presidential debates, and find that it’s far better to win the final argument as opposed to the opening round. You’ll find no shortage of articles online that claim “debates don’t matter,” from pundits and sometimes from political scientists. They pretty much rely on analysis from fellow pundits as to who won. And these involve such factors as “the best zinger,” or how the candidates looked, nonverbal cues, and whether they “answered the question” or not, which can be in the form of a “gotcha” question when the smartest response is often not to answer it, but instead explain your position to the people.

Felling giants: trophy hunters are wiping out Kenya-Tanzania super tuskers - ENACT Africa,https://enactafrica.org/enact-observer/felling-giants-trophy-hunters-are-wiping-out-kenya-tanzania-super-tuskers,2024-09-23,"Despite their declining numbers, super tuskers – bull elephants with tusks weighing over 45 kg each – are being slaughtered by international sport hunters in the Amboseli ecosystem, which stretches along the Kenya-Tanzania border. This hunting is licensed by Tanzania, despite a 1995 agreement between the two countries prohibiting borderland hunting after four Amboseli elephants were killed in 1994. There are fewer than 30 super tuskers remaining worldwide, with only 10 left in the Amboseli ecosystem. This means super tuskers are on the brink of extinction both regionally and globally. Their vulnerability to extinction is exacerbated by the fact that they are often killed in their prime reproductive years. Males aged 40-54, known to have the largest tusks, have the highest reproductive success. There are fewer than 30 super tuskers remaining worldwide – in the Amboseli ecosystem, there are only 10 In March this year, Joseph Ole Lenku, Governor of Kenya’s Kajiado County, raised concerns over three super tuskers killed within the Amboseli ecosystem. Five have also reportedly been killed so far this year in Tanzania’s Enduimet area, around 40 km from the Kenya-Tanzania border. The elephants were part of a 2 000-strong herd that traverse Kenya’s Amboseli National Park and Tanzania’s Enduimet Conservation Area. Elephant movements from the Amboseli Conservancy into the Enduimet area, Kenya-Tanzania border Source: Africa Geographic, 2024 These borderland jumbos frequently cross the Kenya-Tanzania border to forage for food, exposing them to conflicting conservation jurisdictions. This is according to Big Life Foundation Executive Chair Richard Bonham and Dr Paula Kahumbu, Chief Executive of WildlifeDirect, a Kenyan conservation NGO. Trophy hunting in Tanzania is governed by clearly outlined regulations. The Tanzania Wildlife Management Authority specifies that hunting is only permitted between 1 July and 31 December. The regulations also highlight that hunters need to present proof of their kill afterwards, in the form of skin, hooves and other non-edible animal parts. Trophy hunters in Tanzania reportedly pay between US$10 000 and $20 000 for an opportunity to hunt super tuskers. Although the government issues these permits, many licensed hunters do not adhere to the regulations that control the permits, leading to their misuse. The most recent super tusker killings show a clear violation of Tanzania’s hunting regulations. Not only were the elephants hunted outside the permitted hunting period, but their carcasses were also intentionally burnt beyond identification. These breaches point to non-compliance and inadequate regulation oversight, casting doubt on trophy hunting transparency.

"Dryer weather, soil moisture help Ivory Coast's cocoa crop grow - CNBC Africa",https://www.cnbcafrica.com/wire/650274/,,"Dryer weather, soil moisture help Ivory Coast’s cocoa crop grow ABIDJAN, Sept 23 (Reuters) – Dryer weather and high moisture content in most of Ivory Coast’s main cocoa regions continued to boost the development of the next October-to-March main crop last week, farmers said on Monday. The world’s top cocoa producer is in its rainy season which runs officially from April to mid-November. Rains are usually abundant during this period. However, rains were mainly below average last week, farmers said. Dry spells helped beans to dry properly and kept them in good conditions while the moisture content was still high enough to sustain crops. Farmers said that the beans they plan to sell at the opening of the new crop season would be of good quality. Farmers added that they expect to get two harvests per month from October to December as there are many well developed pods of different sizes on trees. They are still stockpiling their first beans in warehouses while waiting for a new farmgate price that they expect to be well above the current 1,500 CFA franc ($2.56) paid per kg. Farmers from the western region of Soubre, where rains were above average last week, from the southern regions of Agboville and Divo and the eastern region of Abengourou, where rains were below average, said they did not have any concerns about the harvest. They added that the crop from October to December would be higher than last year in the same period. “We’ve got nothing to worry about until December. There will be plenty of pods to pick,” said Jonas Bagne, who farms near Soubre, where 23.6 millimetres (mm) of rain fell last week, 5.1 mm above the five-year average. In the west-central region of Daloa and in the central regions of Bongouanou and Yamoussoukro, where rains were below average last week, farmers said they hoped to have",1832,True,0

While the video has prompted a mixed response on social media in terms of comments, some fans believe that the exchange wasn't as awkward as others suggested.One wrote: ""He was talking about Diddy's ring and how much it cost, relating to Benjamins.""You can see him looking down at his ring and holding Puff's hand when he says that.""And another suggested: ""If you listen, he's talking about what's on his finger and his wrist, the drip, diamonds.

He established Nigeria’s first museums in Esie in 1945, Jos in 1952 and Ife in 1955.Mr Cole was studying African art at New York’s Columbia University and conducting fieldwork in Nigeria when Murray assigned him to collect artwork from south-eastern Nigeria for the newer museum in Lagos.Other scholars and Nigerian employees of the museums were tasked with doing this elsewhere in the country.“I collected  on Nigerian artefacts:Nigeria dispute jeopardises return of artefactsBenin Bronzes: 'My great-grandfather sculpted the looted treasures'Ghana, Nigeria and the quest for UK looted treasureGetty Images/BBCGo to BBCAfrica.com for",1446,True,0

The initiative aims to raise awareness of the critical need for early detection of cognitive impairments, emphasising the severe consequences—such as Alzheimer’s and Dementia—of undiagnosed conditions.The campaign’s centerpiece is a poignant video telling the story of a father’s life through a series of Facebook posts, beginning in 1986. As the timeline reverses from 2021, the posts gradually blur, symbolising the devastating effects of Alzheimer’s on memory and cognitive function.Speaking on the importance of early intervention, Ivory’s Co-Founder Issac John shared his personal experience, stating, “Cognitive impairment, if detected earlier, could have made a difference in my father’s condition. Treating Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s remains challenging for modern medicine, and while a perfect solution is still years away, the cost of care is overwhelming. This personal journey fuels my passion for making cognitive care accessible.”John highlighted the often-neglected focus on cognitive health, noting that it should be as common as physical health care. “Our goal is to bring cognitive health into everyday conversations in every household. We want memory care to be as simple and accessible as managing physical health at home. At Ivory, we empower families to take charge of their cognitive health before it’s too late.”Co-Founder Rahul Krishnan echoed these sentiments, pointing to the alarming rise in dementia cases. “From 5.3 million in 2020 to 8.8 million in 2023, the increase in dementia cases shows the urgent need for action. Among those aged 50 to 70, 1 in 3 cognitive impairments can progress to dementia within five years. These are real lives at risk, and we must prioritise cognitive health.” Also Read Jul 26, 2025 Maharashtra Boosts Support For Agencies Aiding TB Detection 1 mins read Jul 26, 2025 Covid Vaccines Not Linked To Sudden Deaths In Young Adults, Says ICMR Study 2 mins read Jul 26, 2025 Dr. Reddy’s Q1 Profit Rises 2 %, Revenue Grows 11.4% Amid US Pricing Pressures 1 mins read Jul 26, 2025 48 Projects Approved Under PLI Scheme To Boost Domestic Production Of Critical APIs 1 mins read Jul 25, 2025 Wellness Is No Longer A Cost, Its Capital: CII–MediBuddy Report Maps Corporate India’s Digital Health Readiness 5 mins read Jul 25, 2025 Cipla Q1 Profit Climbs 10% To Rs 1,298 Crore 2 mins read",2867,True,0

The initiative raises awareness about the often-overlooked risks of cognitive impairments, highlighting the serious consequences, including Alzheimer’s and dementia, if left undiagnosed. As part of the campaign, a heart-warming video tells the story of a father’s life through Facebook posts, beginning in 1986. Each post highlights key moments and milestones, showcasing his life’s progression.

The vocalist says the band will get P2.40 for each P1,900 vinyl record sold MANILA, Philippines – Basti Artadi, vocalist of Filipino rock band Wolfgang, said on Facebook, Wednesday, September 18, that the group is “not supporting the Ivory/Vicor ‘Wolfgang’ vinyl pressing” over the issue of royalty fees. Artadi said that the record labels Ivory Music and Vicor Music, both of which are under the Viva Music Group, will “pay” the band P2.40 for each vinyl record sold at P1,900, or a little over 0.1% for each record sold. It is “P2.40 that Manuel, Wolf, Myself and Mons kids will have to split between each other,” Artadi said, mentioning how that amount will still have to be divided among the himself, the 2 other members and the children of late bassist Mon Legaspi. Furthering his point, Artadi said, “That means if the record company makes 1,900,000 pesos of album sales, Wolfgang gets 600 pesos each.” “2024 and this is the type of stuff that still goes on today when honestly there is enough to go around if people weren’t so greedy,” he added.

Representative image RUDRAPUR: Three men were arrested on Tuesday in a joint operation by the Uttarakhand STF, Uttar Pradesh STF, and Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) Delhi for their alleged involvement in wildlife organ trafficking. Aditya Vikram (24), Karan Singh (40), and Natha Singh (45) were arrested in Uttar Pradesh's Bareilly with two elephant tusks about 3.2 feet long, valued at around Rs 1 crore in the illegal market. Aditya and Karan are from Bareilly, while Natha is from Nanakmatta in Udham Singh Nagar. Navneet Bhullar, SSP of Uttarakhand STF, said, ""We are committed to taking strict action against all involved in wildlife smuggling. Our team has been working to dismantle this network operating along the Uttarakhand-UP border.""The STF had received information that the three accused had been active in wildlife trafficking for some time. On Tuesday, circle officer (CO) of Uttarakhand STF with officials from UP STF and WCCB Delhi conducted a raid in Bareilly's CV Ganj area and the accused were caught with two tusks weighing around 7kg. They had initially sought to sell the ivory for Rs 70 lakh, with an aim to raise the price to Rs 1 crore.Aditya claimed the ivory was passed down from his maternal grandfather.

M. Forster and Henry James, that even some astute filmgoers assumed it was a studio or a brand. It was both those things, but it was foremost the names of two men—US-born director James Ivory and India-born producer Ismail Merchant—who together formed a partnership that changed modern moviemaking. L-r: Ismail Merchant, James Ivory That’s the major takeaway from Stephen Soucy’s illuminating and entertaining documentary Merchant Ivory. It details how the filmmaking team that included writer Ruth Prawer Jhabvala and composer Richard Robbins managed, against the odds, to bring so many luminous classics to the big screen in the 1980s and ‘90s such as The Bostonians (1984); A Room with a View (1986); Maurice (1987); Howards End (1992); and The Remains of the Day (1993). Besides this rich film history, the film offers a delightful behind-the-scenes look at the often tumultuous personal relationship between Merchant and Ivory, a couple from 1961 until Merchant’s death during abdominal surgery in 2005. “The Merchant Ivory story is the iceberg above the water, but there was all this big stuff beneath the water’s surface that I wanted to navigate through,” says director Stephen Soucy. “They were such fiercely independent filmmakers from day one and for many, many years. They didn’t even get into the studio system until the ‘90s.” A theater producer who’s made several short films, Soucy directed the animated short Rich Atmosphere: The Music of Merchant Ivory Films in 2019. The film focuses on composer Robbins, who scored 21 Merchant Ivory productions. It impressed James Ivory, now 96 and the only living member of the Merchant Ivory quartet. “I interviewed him twice, then brought the finished film with narration and super cool animation that Jim loved. He was over the moon with it. So I sensed an opportunity,” said Soucy. “I said, as a huge Merchant Ivory fan, [he should] let me make the definite look at what Merchant Ivory was.” Even though Soucy had not yet made a feature film, Ivory said yes. “That’s very Jim. Many people, such as Maurice producer Paul Bradley, said that when they first started with him, they didn’t have much experience. But Jim gave many people the chance, and they stepped up. I’d only made shorts, but Jim thought I could do it.” L-r: James Ivory, Ismail Merchant Ivory’s blessing led Soucy to the dazzling array of interviews he assembled for the film, including actors Hugh Grant, Helena Bonham Carter, Vanessa Redgrave, Emma Thompson, Rupert Graves and James Wilby; Jenny Beavan and John Bright, who won an Oscar for their costumes in A Room With a View; and many",2874,True,0

Elephant poaching: Why it's a big problem | IFAW,https://www.ifaw.org/international/journal/elephant-poaching-problem,,"Skip to main contentAbout IFAWNewsanimal welfarepoachingBlogElephant poaching: Why it’s a big problemElephant poaching: Why it’s a big problemSeptember 13, 2024Want to help protect elephants?Join IFAWElephants, known for their intelligence, size, and distinct appearance, face a major threat from poaching—an illegal practice driven by the demand for ivory and other elephant products. They are one of the most heavily poached mammals in the world, with a staggering 90% of African elephants being killed by poachers within the last 100 years. Over 100 tons of ivory were burned in Nairobi, Kenya in 2016, as one of the largest ivory burns in history. Photo: © IFAWPoaching endangers individual elephants and the wider species, destabilises entire ecosystems, and poses a significant challenge to global biodiversity efforts.IFAW is an organisation dedicated to conservation and rescue around the world. A core part of our work involves anti-poaching initiatives to protect elephants in Africa and Asia.In this article, we’ll explore elephant poaching, its causes, impacts, and ongoing efforts to combat this devastating practice.What is poaching?Poaching is the term used to describe the illegal hunting, killing, or live capturing of wild animals, usually for commercial gain. This could be for a particular body part, such as their fur, horns, tusks, teeth, meat, skin, etc., or for the live animal trade. Poaching threatens the survival of many species around the world.Elephants in particular are targeted for their ivory tusks, which are in particularly high demand in illegal wildlife trade. Unfortunately, there has been a recent surge in elephant poaching. In Botswana—which was once considered to be a sanctuary for wildlife—poachers are carrying out illegal hunting within the national parks. They are often targeting ‘big tusker’ elephants, which are males with the largest ivory tusks to offer.Why are elephants poached?An Asian elephant herd walking through a man-made path near a forest in Meng'a Town, Yunnan Province, China. Photo: © Xuan ZhengElephant poaching is usually driven by a demand for their tusks. Elephant tusks are made out of ivory. Ivory is in high demand in various parts of the world, particularly in Asia, where it is used for ornaments, jewellery, and traditional medicine.A 2023 study by the Center for Advanced Defense Studies (C4ADS) found that geographical patterns of elephant ivory continue to adhere to Africa-to-Asia trafficking routes, meaning elephants are being poached for their tusks in African countries and being illegally transported overseas to supply the demand in Asian countries.Poaching is a complicated issue that often arises from a lack of income sources for people who live close to wildlife. A 2019 study found that elephant poaching increases where there is a lack of income-generating opportunities. In a 2017 survey, 164 out of 173 respondents who admitted to poaching said they would stop poaching if they had income to support their families.Human-wildlife conflict can also be a source of tension between humans and elephants, which can lead to humans ignoring legal measures taken to protect the species. Where elephants may destroy crops and agriculture, it can lead to humans killing or harming the animals to protect their livelihoods or in retaliation.As a conservation organisation, IFAW works to actively create and support alternative livelihood opportunities for communities where poaching may be an issue. Some examples of our work include the Jenga Mama project in Kenya, which provides vocational training to Maasai women and helps them start their own small businesses, and the Chikolongo Livelihood Project in Malawi, which ensured access to clean water, established a community fish farm, and developed an incentive system to encourage the growth of commercial crops. We also support a project in Zambia alongside COMACO, which trains farmers in sustainable, climate-smart agricultural techniques to support their livelihoods.Donate now to protect elephants and other wildlifeWhere is elephant poaching a problem?In 2021, an elephant conservation programme Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE), found that around 40% of elephant deaths were due to poaching. Here’s a breakdown of how poaching affects each individual elephant species.African elephantsAfrican elephants were originally treated as one species, but as of 2021, they are now recognised as two separate species: the African forest elephant and the African savannah elephant. Both species saw steep declines in their populations when poaching surged in 2008. This surge in illegal elephant hunting peaked around 2011, though it continues to threaten African elephant populations today. In 2016, the African Elephant Status Report estimated that 415,428 African elephants lived across the continent, with a decline of approximately 110,000 individuals over the previous decade. Their combined estimated population as of 2021 is 415,000 elephants.According to the 2023 report by C4ADS, the most common countries of origin for shipments of elephant ivory seized from traffickers were Ethiopia (18.4%), Nigeria (17.6%), Democratic Republic of the Congo (8.8%), and Mozambique (8.8%). However, these countries where the shipment originated do not necessarily reflect where the elephants were initially poached, as many of these countries have much sparser or nonexistent elephant populations in comparison to southern African states. For instance, the report suggests that the prevalence of Mozambique and Angola as countries of shipment origin is",5600,True,0

This revelation came during a Parliamentary session on Tuesday when MP Joseph Bonda questioned the government’s strategy for controlling the growing elephant population. “With the elephant population now at 100 000—double the recommended ecological balance—and causing starvation and deaths among the animals themselves, does the government have plans to reduce the numbers by culling and distributing the meat to schools, prisons, and drought-stricken communities?” MP Bonda asked. He further emphasized that Zimbabwe is not restricted by CITES from consuming its wildlife resources. In response, Dr Nyoni confirmed that discussions are underway with ZimParks and local communities to explore a program similar to one in Namibia, where elephant meat is distributed to those in need. “Zimbabwe has",1015,True,0

'Merchant Ivory' Captures Couple that Changed Cinema - Newport This Week,https://www.newportthisweek.com/articles/merchant-ivory-captures-couple-that-changed-cinema/,2024-09-12,"The documentary “Merchant Ivory,” coming to the Jane Pickens Theater, details the personal and professional partnership between director James Ivory, left, and producer Ismail Merchant. The name Merchant Ivory is so synonymous with lustrous period films, particular the literary adaptations of the works of E. M. Forster and Henry James, that even some astute filmgoers assumed it was a studio or a brand. It was both those things, but it was foremost the names of two men, US-born director James Ivory and India-born producer Ismail Merchant, who together formed a partnership that changed modern moviemaking. That’s the major takeaway from director Stephen Soucy’s documentary, “Merchant Ivory,” which screens Sept. 21-24 at the Jane Pickens Theater, where Ivory has appeared several times in person to screen his films and engage in conversation. The film is not only important film history, it’s a behind-thescenes look at the often-tumultuous personal relationship between Merchant and Ivory, who were open but discreet as a couple from 1961 until Merchant’s unexpected 2005 death during abdominal surgery. Soucy, who wrote the documentary with Jon Hart, details how the ultra-indie filmmaking team that included writer Ruth Prawer Jhabvala and composer Richard Robbins managed, against the odds, to bring so many luminous classics to the big screen. One can’t imagine coming of age as a movie buff in the 1980s and ’90s without “A Room with a View” (1986) and “Howards End” (1992), which both screen at the Jane Pickens Theater this month, and “The Remains of the Day” (1993), the film that author and critic John Pym calls “the jewel in Merchant Ivory’s crown.” Loren King is an arts and entertainment writer whose work appears regularly in The Boston Globe and other publications. The documentary is compressive enough to chart the entire Merchant Ivory oeuvre. Film clips and commentary span the company’s 40-plus films, made between 1963 and 2009, with much attention paid to their early Indian-set dramas, “The Householder” (1963), based on screenwriter Jhabvala’s novel, and “Shakespeare Wallah” (1965), about a troupe of actors traveling across India that took the Berlin Film Festival by storm and put Merchant and Ivory on the world cinema map. Soucy has assembled a dazzling array of interviewees, including actors Hugh Grant, Helena Bonham Carter, Rupert Graves, James Wilby and Emma Thompson, who  for his adaptation of “Call Me by Your Name,” the accolades gave him the opportunity to not only acknowledge the broad shoulders of his late partners Merchant, Jhabvala and Robbins, but to cite the trail blazed by his own film, “Maurice.” “Merchant Ivory” documents Ivory’s single-minded determination to make “Maurice” in the mid-1980s. With AIDS at its peak and with Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative government enacting the homophobic Section 28, naysayers questioned why Merchant Ivory would take such a risk right after the commercial success of “A Room with a View.” It’s precisely that commitment to bold, brave and honest storytelling that is Merchant Ivory’s legacy, a legacy that is cemented by Soucy’s essential and entertaining film.

Genitalia illegally cut from girls in “circumcision” ceremonies is used in several regions of the West African country to “make love potions” or magic ointments that some believe will help them “make money or reach high political office”, said Labe Gneble, head of the National Organisation for Women, Children and the Family (ONEF). Agence France-Presse TOUBA, Ivory Coast — When he was a witch doctor, Moussa Diallo would regularly smear himself in a lotion made from a clitoris cut from a girl subjected to female genital mutilation. “I wanted to be a big chief, I wanted to dominate,” said the small but charismatic fiftysomething from northwest Ivory Coast. Article continues after this  “I put it on my face and body” every three months or so “for about three years”, said Diallo, who asked AFP not to use his real name.  than a quarter of a century. Despite that, one in five Ivorian women are still being cut, according to the OECD, with one in two being mutilated in parts of the north. Cut and mixed with plants Before he had a crisis of conscience and decided to campaign against FGM, Diallo said he was often asked by the women who performed excisions around the small town of Touba to use his powers to protect them from evil spells. Female circumcision has been practised by different religions in West Africa for centuries, with most girls cut between childhood and adolescence. Many families consider it a rite of passage or a way to control and repress female sexuality, according to UN children’s agency UNICEF, which condemns cutting as a dangerous violation of girls’ fundamental rights. Beyond the physical and psychological pain, cutting can be fatal, lead to sterility, birth complications, chronic infections and bleeding, not to mention the loss of sexual pleasure. Diallo would often accompany the women who do the cutting out into the forest or to a home where dozens of girls would be circumcised, often surrounded by fetishes and sacred objects. So it was relatively easy for the former faith healer to obtain the precious powder. “When they would cut the clitorises they would dry them for a month or two then pound them with stones,” he said. The result was a “black powder” which was then sometimes mixed with “leaves, roots and bark” or shea butter that is often used in cosmetics. They could then sell it for around “100,000 CFA Francs (152 euros) if the girl was a virgin” or “65,000 (99 euros) if she already had a child” or barter it for goods and services, Diallo added. The ex-witch doctor said he was able to get some of the powder recently — a mix of human flesh and plants, he believes — from a cutter in his village. AFP was shown the powder but was unable to analyze it without buying it. ‘Organ trafficking’ Former circumcisers interviewed by AFP insisted that clitorises cut from girls are either buried, thrown into a river or given to the parents, depending on local custom. But one in the west of the country admitted some end up being used for magic. “Some people pretend they are the girls’ parents and go off with the clitoris,” she said. Witch doctors use them for “incantations” and sell them afterwards, she claimed. Another circumciser said some of her colleagues were complicit in the trade, “giving (genitalia) to people who are up to no good” for occult purposes. Mutilated when she was still a child, one victim told AFP that her mother warned her to bring home the flesh that had been cut. The trade is regarded as “organ trafficking” in Ivorian law and is punishable —",3697,True,0

Photo provided by Diane Meuller SHELBY TOWNSHIP — The Shelby Township Fine Art Society recently announced the members of its group who received special awards during the Shelby Township Art Fair Aug. 10-11. During the art fair, attendees were able to cast votes for their favorite art works by members of the society. Four Shelby Township Fine Art Society artists had paintings that were voted community favorites. There were 2,815 votes cast to come up with the four winners. First place went to Cathy McCarty for “Majestic Blue.” Second place was awared to Karen Ann for “Whispered Grace.” Third place went to Diane Radke for “Chasing Rainbows,” and an honorable mention was given to Bea Allebone for “Alpha Pair.” Sara Katsavrias, president of the society, said the members came through with another impressive art show for those who attended this year’s Shelby Township Art Fair. “We had 81 pieces of art from 30 members of our very talented group. There were 2,815 votes cast in this People’s Choice-awarded show to come up with four winners. We have many winners in Shelby Township’s Fine Art Society and look forward to showing the community our work for many years to come,” she said. McCarty said she loves painting nature, especially endangered species. “One of my favorite beasts to paint is the African elephant, who have almost been lost to poaching due to their beautiful ivory tusks. That is why I always paint my elephants with a broken tusk — to remind us that humans have the power to help them stay on the earth we share with them,” she said. Ann said “Whispered Grace” was created “to show the perfection found in nature, as shown in a single petal’s delicate detailing and beautiful colors.” Radke said “Chasing Rainbows” shows a dog named Dexter having fun chasing bubbles. “He always enjoyed playing outside and would chase most anything. The artwork is 100% colored pencil on black paper,” she said. Allebone said “Alpha Pair” is an acrylic painting of intelligent, devoted and caring grey wolves in a 20-inch-round cradled wood panel. “Thank you to the Shelby Township Art Fair and C & G Newspapers for supporting the arts and Shelby Township Fine Art Society,” she said.

THIS STORY CONTAINS MENTIONS OF FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION. When he was a witch doctor, Moussa Diallo would regularly smear himself in a lotion made from a clitoris cut from a girl subjected to female genital mutilation. “I wanted to be a big chief, I wanted to dominate,” said the small but charismatic fiftysomething from northwest Ivory Coast. “I put it on my face and body” every three months or so “for about three years”, said Diallo, who asked AFP not to use his real name. Genitalia cut from girls in illegal “circumcision” ceremonies is used in several regions of the West African country to “make love potions” or magic ointments that some believe will help them “make money or reach high political office”, said Labe Gneble, head of the National Organisation for Women, Children and the Family (ONEF). A ground down clitoris can sell for up to around $170, the equivalent of what many in Ivory Coast earn in a month. Diallo stopped using the unctions a decade ago, but regional police chief Lieutenant N’Guessan Yosso confirmed to AFP that dried clitorises are still “very sought after for mystical practices”. And it is clear from extensive interviews AFP conducted with former faith healers, circumcisers, social workers, researchers and NGOs, that there is a thriving traffic in female genitalia for the powers they supposedly impart. Many are convinced the trade is hampering the fight against female genital mutilation (FGM), which has been banned in the religiously diverse nation for",1517,True,0

The Elephants Are Coming! A Striking Traveling Exhibition Troops Through Manhattan's ... - Vogue,https://www.vogue.com/article/the-great-elephant-migration-lands-in-new-york,2024-09-09,"Skip to main contentSave StorySave this storySave StorySave this story“It was really just a vision that dropped in my head: Let’s make a herd of 100 elephants and migrate them across America,” says Ruth Ganesh, a UK-born animal rights activist, conservationist, and arts advocate. After moving to the United States, her new home had her musing about the Route 66 cross-country road trip. But she also had another idea: “Could these elephants be made out of something that was entirely good for the environment?”It wasn’t until Ganesh connected with Tarsh Thekaekara—an animal researcher and conservationist based in India who had long studied elephant behaviors—that her phantasm morphed into a joyous, roving art installation, with New York as the next stop in its national tour. “The Great Elephant Migration” will be on view around the Meatpacking District through October 20.The elephant sculptures are life-size, modeled after real-life cows (female elephants), bulls (male elephants), tuskers (male elephants with tusks), and lovable little calves, all made from dried lantana plants—an invasive species that crowds out native plant life, reduces biodiversity, and encroaches on wildlife habitats. (This was at Thekaekara’s suggestion: He has been working with indigenous populations in India to craft furniture out of the plant.)Photo: Mark Warner“[Thekaekara] added so much texture to the project because of his work with the elephant personalities—they’ve all got names, and the craftspeople who make the elephants know the characters of the elephants as well,” Ganesh says.But why elephants? “The Great Elephant Migration” is a story of coexistence. Historically, elephants and humans in India have been able to live peacefully together, but urban development and habitat loss have resulted in shrinking elephant populations. So the project places sculpted elephants into busy, human-populated quarters as a reminder that this land is ours to telling way of looking at the world,” Ganesh says. “It’s not humans over here and animals over there in some protected area.”The first stop of the migration was Hyde Park in London during the pandemic. Prototyping the elephants, and then crafting enough to make 100, took years. (“It was always 100. It had to be completely and utterly unreasonable,” Ganesh jokes.)

While most materials are periodically incinerated, ivory is stored for longer periods.Ivory that's received from others districts is stored at the zoo for extended periods, with zoo authorities claiming that inventory checks on the ivory are rarely conducted. The theft of ivory from the zoo should have been happening for a long period, the source said.A senior official from the zoo confirmed that stock verification was last done a month ago, and another check will be conducted soon in light of the theft. A committee has been formed to investigate the case. Zoo authorities suspect the involvement of Sathish, a temporary worker assigned to Range 3, the rescue and rehabilitation centre, which oversees storage areas. Sathish has gone missing since the theft.Wildlife experts suggest that apart from regular ‘stock-taking,' the zoo management needs to improve security measures in the storage areas, including installation of CCTV cameras and better surveillance. They also recommend conducting monthly stock checks to prevent future thefts.End of Article ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories PreviousHow to make vrat-friendly Coconut Peanut Chutney at homeFoodHow to make your 'Curry patta' plant grow fasterLifestyle10 plants that can be grown without soil (you only need water!)Lifestyle10 countries known for their wildlifetravel​10 things you should never say to an older person​Lifestyle​10 stunningly beautiful parrots in the world​Lifestyle10 most iconic animals from the world of fiction and literatureLifestyle10 animals that live in waterLifestyle10 types of vegetable-based cheela for healthy breakfastFood8 signs a child is smarter than averageLifestyle Next123 Photostories Bigg Boss 18: Confirmed list of the contestants of Salman Khan hosted controversial showSchengen visa denials: 5 countries with the highest rejection rates6 mantras that are believed to help students develop focus and concentration5 countries with the best anti-aircraft missile systems in the worldSanjay Dutt-Manyata to Hardik Pandya-Natasa Stankovic: Bollywood couples who renewed their wedding vows8 animals that help Earth heal and how5 psychology tips to be",2709,True,0

SHRC upholds Wayanad collector's right to keep tusks displayed in office - Onmanorama,https://www.onmanorama.com/news/kerala/2024/09/07/wayanad-collector-tusks-human-rights-commission.html,2024-09-07,"Kalpetta: The State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) has dismissed a complaint seeking the removal of a pair of elephant tusks displayed in the District Collector's chamber . The decision was made on Friday after reviewing a report submitted by District Collector D R Meghasree. This was the second complaint filed this year concerning the tusks displayed in the Collector’s chamber. In 2020, local environmental groups lodged a similar complaint with the Department of Wildlife Protection, alleging that the display of the tusks could promote hunting in the region. The latest complaint, filed by Adv K V Devadas of Kannur, was addressed by SHRC Judicial Member Adv K Baijunath. The panel ruled in favour of keeping the tusks on display. The District Collector reported that the state government had legally allocated the tusks to the district on December 21, 1990, through a special order. The Chief Wildlife Warden issued an ownership certificate (40/91) on August 20, 1991, the Collector reported. Wayanad District Collector D R Meghasree posing in front of the tusks. Photo: Facebook/Wayanad District Collector The report clarified that the tusks had been displayed for over three decades and had not contributed to any wildlife crimes in the district. It emphasised that the tusks symbolise the administration's commitment to wildlife conservation and highlight the district’s rich wildlife heritage. The controversy began with a complaint filed by Ilangoli Abdurahman, a resident of Madakkimala, in May of this year. His concerns were sparked by a widely circulated photograph of former District Collector Dr Renu Raj posing in front of the tusks, which appeared in newspapers and on social media. In his complaint, Abdurahman argued that the tusks should be stored securely in compliance with existing laws rather than displayed in the District Collector’s office. He raised concerns about the message it sent to the public, questioning its propriety in a democratic society where everyone should be treated equally under the law. He also questioned the tusks' authenticity and expressed concern over the cruelty involved in removing tusks from elephants. The history of the tusks dates back to June 15, 1990, when then-Wayanad District Collector Michel Vedasiromani narrowly escaped an elephant attack in Chekadi village near Pulppalli. The tusks belonged to the aggressive elephant that had caused significant destruction and even attacked the Collector’s vehicle. During the attack, the gunman, T M Joseph, narrowly avoided injury as he found himself between the elephant's tusks. After a narrow escape, the team sought refuge in a farmer's house. The elephant was eventually shot, and the tusks were placed in the Collectorate as a memorial to the incident. Home Videos Podcast Search Web Stories",2806,True,0

'Merchant Ivory' doc celebrates icons of cinema - Boston Herald,https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/09/08/merchant-ivory-doc-celebrates-icons-of-cinema/,2024-09-08,"The spectacular, enduring career of the creative team known as Merchant Ivory gets a worthy summation in the documentary of the same name, now playing at the Kendall Square. The decades-long partnership of the trio — producer Ismail Merchant, director James Ivory and screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala — revitalized the historical costume picture with adaptations by literary lions E.M. Forster (“A Room with a View,” “Howard’s End,” “Maurice”), Henry James (“The Bostonians”) and Kazuo Ishiguro (“The Remains of the Day”). At 96, Ivory is the sole surviving member. In a phone conversation Friday he discussed his late-career Oscar win for adapting the hit queer romance “Call Me By Your Name,” who was the sole “crazy” among the many actors he directed and why he now marvels at what he was able to put on film forever. How is it to see your life condensed in a two-hour film? “I was intrigued — and not in any sense dismayed. Because there wasn’t anything there that was some sort of surprise that I wouldn’t want to have the world know about.” Does he divide his career as Before and After the 1985 “A Room with a View”? “In a way, because that was the first big hit we had. We had other hits before but ‘Room’ was a really big hit.” Winning an Oscar with “Call Me” at 89? He’s the oldest Academy Award winner ever. “I have been nominated three times before but I didn’t win. Then suddenly, for this film, sure, who wouldn’t want to have an Oscar?” A filmmaker for decades, he says, “I’ve been lucky. I never really had to work — with one exception! — with actors who were crazy or temperamental or unreasonable about anything.” Who was the exception? “Raquel Welch,” the sex symbol star of their 1975 period piece “The Wild Party.” “She was not easy to work with.

That Ivory’s frankness is “unexpected” though, reiterates the too-common, misaligned critique that the films Ivory made, mostly in partnership with Ismail Merchant, were merely stuffy costume dramas and period pieces, rather than elegantly sketched moving portraits of men stunted by social and political  of the heroic women of E.

The Modern Endangered Archives Program, or MEAP, a UCLA Library initiative that expands the capacity for digital preservation around the world, has announced 26 new grants awarded to communities and archives from 21 countries. MEAP will provide $1.47 million in grants to its sixth cohort of grantees — the most in the program’s history. The selected projects will document and digitize a broad range of cultural heritage materials including: archival materials in eastern Ukraine; films in Ghana; newspapers in India; and architectural plans in Morocco. MEAP’s first project in the Ivory Coast to digitize the photographic archive of Paul Kodjo, “the father of Ivorian photography,” is also one of the grant winners. The program was launched in 2018 with support from Arcadia, a charitable fund of Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin. To date, over $5 million in grants have funded 139 projects in 57 countries. The grants support resource digitization, as well as the training and professional development needed for local scholars to perform the archival work they envision. This year, half the awardees are receiving a second round of funding to apply the skills and knowledge they’ve gained to the next step in their cultural preservation projects. Digitization efforts to safeguard materials that represent diverse voices and perspectives often excluded from the historical record are also among the winners. Several archival collections will use MEAP funds to expand and reimagine Latin American history. These collections include posters, photographs and audiovisual materials that document movements such as human rights activism in the Andean countryside of Peru, efforts to investigate cases of forced disappearances throughout Latin America, and rural responses in Brazil during a period of mass immigration.

Police working with agents from the Ministry of Environment and Forestry announced on Aug. 27 the arrest of a 60-year-old man in Palembang, South Sumatra province, for allegedly attempting to sell eight rhino horns, five tobacco pipes made of elephant ivory, and three pipes made from dugong tusks. The arrest took place on Aug. 23 during a string operation as the suspect, identified only by the initials Z.A., attempted to sell the products. Authorities said they identified four of the rhino horns as belonging to Indonesian species, and the other four from abroad, but didn’t specify which ones. Indonesia is home to two critically endangered rhino species, the Sumatran (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis) and Javan (Rhinoceros sondaicus), each with a total estimated population of less than 100. “This is a transnational crime,” Rasio Ridho Sani, the environment ministry’s director-general of law enforcement, told reporters. “We continue to strengthen the partnership with international law enforcement agencies, such as the Interpol and UNODC [United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime].” Conservation authorities and local police in Palembang, South Sumatra, announced the arrest of a 60-year-old suspect, in the orange vest, for alleged trafficking of eight rhino horns and elephant and dugong ivory.

The incident came to light when the Tamil Nadu Wildlife Crime Control Bureau and Tambaram forest range office conducted a joint operation and arrested four people, who were trying to sell the tusks. Sources told TNIE that the joint operation was conducted on August 25 and two tusks were seized from the accused near the Madras Christian College bus stop. “The tusks are not from fully grown elephants. One is a sub-adult male elephant tusk measuring just over one foot and another one is a tush of a female elephant.”During interrogation, the arrested confessed that they got the tusks from Satish alias Appu, a casual employee working with Vandalur Zoo for the past five years. It is suspected that Satish might have probably stolen the tusks from the huge ivory stockpile of Vandalur Zoo. Vandalur Zoo director Ashish Kumar Srivastava confirmed to TNIE that the zoo’s casual worker was involved in the elephant tusk trafficking, but whether the tusks were stolen from the zoo’s stockpile or from elsewhere can be only drawn after he is arrested. “We did an inventory verification a month back during which no anomaly was detected. We are also carrying out an internal investigation,” Srivastava said. When asked why the zoo authorities kept the huge stockpile of ivory instead of destroying them, Srivastava admitted the stockpile should have been safely destroyed long back and that storing it was a security risk. “I will initiate and write to higher authorities seeking to destroy the ivory stockpile.” Meanwhile, sources said the accused Satish, who was employed at the zoo’s rescue centre, has reportedly told the forest officials that he would surrender. The theft allegedly took place two years back and the zoo authorities are checking the CCTV footage near the stockpile room to confirm the crime, sources added..Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp Download the TNIE app to stay with us and",2039,True,0

Terseer Ugbor said Nigeria needs strong legislation to protect wildlife if she must earn from the wildlife sector. In an interview with Arise TV on Thursday, Ugbor noted elephant tusks cost $100,000 in the international market, but the law only recommended ₦10,000 fine for poachers. He stated that law enforcement officers also aid and abet poachers to carry out their trafficking of wildlife. “Legislation is everything. Conservation efforts have to depend on stronger penalties and stronger laws to deter poachers, to deter traffickers from engaging in this business. Several years ago in Nigeria, there was a case where an elephant was killed in Nigeria. And the people who committed this illegal activity were arrested, but they were never persecuted. “Recently, there was an elephant that was killed in Burunu by soldiers and a local government chairman.

Chirume carvings implore elephants preservation - NewsDay Zimbabwe,https://www.newsday.co.zw/life-amp-style/article/200031800/chirume-carvings-implore-elephants-preservation,2024-09-03,"CHITUNGWIZA-BASED visual artist Joshua Chirume explores various characteristics of his totem animal, the elephant and engraves them into highly expressive and realistic fine art stone figurines. A visit and conversation with Chirume at his Chitungwiza Arts Centre workplace and exhibition garden revealed that elephants, especially from the African savannah, are the largest land animals in the world, which can run and swim for long distances. His carvings show many postures of elephant tusks in either browsing, grazing, debarking trees, walking, destroying and/or swimming positions. There are three types of elephants, namely the African Savannah (Bush), African Forest and the Asian. Chirume’s passion for carving elephants carries the day for someone who recognises World Elephant Day, celebrated annually on August 12. Usually, the day is used to rally people to support organisations that are working to stop illegal poaching and trade of elephant ivory and other wildlife products, protect wild elephant habitat and provide sanctuaries and alternative habitats for domesticated elephants to live freely. “This herd shows a family of elephants being led by its eldest member. The bull leads the family to grazing land and resting points, including protecting them from enemies,” Chirume said. “Elephants can travel for a long distance and may even cross borders. They eat a lot and often destroy fields.” Chirume carves most of his works on springstone and a captivating feature of his carvings is his attention to detail. His elephant carvings try to impeccably recreate the jumbos’ hard bark skin. The carvings also bring out why leather products from the jumbos are quite expensive on the market. Despite their hard skin, elephants fear bees and can sprint away from them, creating an interesting sight and ambience as they scurry to safety. In case someone happens to be in their way, they should be careful of a stampede. Surprisingly, the huge animals cannot jump. Some day, they may result in avalanches as land subsides each time they try to create their paths on the edges of mountains. “Given . These carvings help children to develop a desire to visit nearby game parks one day in the future,” Chirume said. “In addition to that, these carvings, when they are taken into homes or offices for decoration, complement other decorations to beautify the place. “Elephants are preserved because they create economies through trophy hunting competitions. Also, their meat and leather are equally expensive on the market. They are a good national investment because elephants can live up to 60 years if well taken care of.” An elephants is one of the easily remembered animals of the Big Five, a list which also includes lions, rhinos, buffalos and leopards. During commemorations to mark World Elephants Day sometime back, organised by the American embassy Public Affairs section, it was revealed that close to 90% of African elephants were killed by poachers and trophy hunters. The gathering resolved that children should be taught at infancy how to preserve natural resources and the wildlife that is around them. It is estimated that Africa now only has about 415 000 elephants. Chirume who, started carving in 2000, was taught by his brother Josiah Edmore Chirume. He has also tried to carve groups of elephants or elephant families on hard stones",3365,True,0

US. 2024. 129mins Aiming to be a blistering examination of America’s unwinnable War on Drugs, the high-octane King Ivory is intense without being insightful. The eighth feature from writer-director John Swab takes us to Tulsa, Oklahoma, one of the new battlegrounds between overmatched law enforcement and well-armed criminals, who are getting rich selling fentanyl to eager customers. James Badge Dale gives a suitably gritty performance as a cop determined to wipe out these drug dealers — unaware that his own son is an addict — but this action-thriller is too easily in thrall to its tough-guy posturing, resulting in a picture that incorrectly believes it’s delivering bitter truths. There is a noticeable lack of originality to this violent tale of cops and crooks King Ivory premieres in Venice’s Horizons Extra section, the first of Swab’s features to unspool on the Lido.

But the hunters who killed one of Africa’s semi-tame elephants knew they’d done wrong – so they took Gilgil’s massive ivory tusks and burned his body.Now wildlife experts fear that foreign hunters may soon wipe out the last of Africa’s “super tusker” elephants which have all become habituated to humans – meaning they trust people and have no expectation of harm from them.The experts say the latest killing threatens the gene pool of these huge elephants with giant tusks each weighing over 100lbs (45kg).Gilgil was 35 when he was allegedly killed last December, the age when an elephant bull begins his prime breeding years. He was from a group of at least 30 male elephants who use the West Kilimanjaro in Tanzanian territory as a “bull area” to put on weight ahead of breeding in Kenya, says Cynthia Moss who has been studying the elephants for decades.He was one of five mature African elephant bulls that have been shot dead by foreign hunters, close to Tanzania’s border with Kenya and the Amboseli National Park. While all hunting is banned in Kenya, in Tanzania hunting is seen as a revenue stream for conservation. Gilgil, a mature African elephant bull shot dead by hunters near the Kenya-Tanzania border, pictured in 2018 (Photo: Dr Vicki Fishlock/ Amboseli Trust For Elephants)Dr Moss summed up the outrage felt by conservationists after the deaths of Gilgil and the other “super-tuskers” since last September.“Killing an Ambosel bull is about as sporting as shooting your neighbour’s poodle,” she said. Dr Moss denied that the hunters had shared photographs of elephant they had killed.Joyce Poole, another elephant expert with decades of work in Amboseli, says that hunters in a vehicle could have got within six feet of Gilgil. “Amboseli elephant are less tolerant of people on foot but would not have run from human scent,” said Dr Poole, director of Elephant Voices.Zidane Janbeck, director of Kilombero North Safaris who took a client to hunt the elephant identified as Gilgil insisted that the tusker that was shot by his client was a different animal altogether.Three of the elephants killed since September were taken by clients with the Kilombero North Safaris and shot by American tourists who are still allowed to bring tusks home as private trophies from their killings.The co-director of the same company, which has several hunting concessions in the north of Tanzania, Quentin Whitehead, insisted that if the Kenyan-based researchers sent them details of which elephant were strongly habituated, then shooting them could be avoided.Dr Cynthia Moss, programme director and trustee at the Amboseli Trust for Elephants (Photo: Amboseli Trust For Elephants)He told i: “Well-known habituated elephants, collared elephants [wearing trackers for research] are all off limits.

Ken Ivory takes a victory lap on school book bans, says there’s ‘more work to do’ Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Listen • 1:17 As the school year gets underway, the driving force behind Utah’s “sensitive materials” laws is taking a moment to crow about the 13 books banned statewide from public K-12 libraries.As he stood among supporters at the center of easels displaying passages from the books, Republican state Rep. Ken Ivory said the works were too “pornographic” to show elsewhere. He told a packed room of adults in the Utah State Capitol to see for themselves what has been in schools.“This is not ‘Catcher in the Rye.’ This is not ‘To Kill a Mockingbird,’” he said. “These are X-rated materials.”Each of the displayed posters had pink sticky notes covering certain words Ivory feared might make the selections too “obscene” to legally show in public, at the advice of legislative attorneys. Some of the words alluded to sexual activity and suicide. Multiple selections were from fantasy writer Sarah J. Maas, one of the seven authors on the statewide list. Martha Harris / KUEREnthusiastic supporters of Utah’s sensitive materials laws filled a room at the Utah State Capitol in Salt Lake City, Aug. 29, 2024. Ivory’s new law, which updated his original “sensitive materials” law, created the mechanism for a statewide ban. Titles have to first be removed from either three school districts, or two school school districts and five charter schools, for being “objective sensitive material.” That means the work is considered “pornographic or indecent” as defined in state code.The Utah State Board of Education keeps track of when books meet that threshold and can overturn any of the bans. They released their first list in early August.Joining Ivory for his Aug. 29 news conference were parents, members of the clergy, educators and Utah Congressman Burgess Owens — who told the assembled crowd the passages on display were “smut.” Many enthusiastically agreed.“What we’re seeing here in these books is Marxist ideology that hates everything we stand for,” Owens said.“Utah has it right once again. We are the state that prioritizes our kids.” Martha Harris / KUERCongressman Burgess Owens spoke at Rep. Ken Ivory’s Aug. 29, 2024, news conference at the Utah State Capitol and celebrated the recent statewide book ban in K-12 schools. Utah State Board of Education member Jennie Earl told the crowd she was grateful for the engagement of parents, educators and administrators. Earl said as school districts and charter schools continue to report books they deem objective sensitive material, “we may have other books that [will] be removed that meet this criteria that is harmful for minors.”Pastor Chuck Beickel of Faith Baptist Church pointed to the posters and called on the authors to repent.“These authors will bow their knee before the King of kings and Lord of lords, and confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,” Beickel proclaimed, which was met with “amen” from the crowd.“I hope they'll take this warning. I hope they'll change their hearts and change their minds.”Ivory also had a bone to pick with the news media over coverage of books being banned. He again singled out KSL, which is part of a company owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He said the coverage was condescending to the parents and lawmakers who pushed for this to happen.“We had some media that announced and said that it was a ‘dark day’ when we were protecting children from materials that they can't quote to adults, that cannot be  work to do.”",3561,True,0

'I miss home': 13-year-old Nigerian girls trapped as sex workers in Ivory Coast | Nigeria,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/aug/26/i-miss-home-13-year-old-nigerian-girls-trapped-as-sex-workers-in-ivory-coast,2024-08-26,"The first French phrases Nigerian teenager Sara* learned when she arrived in the city of Bouaké were “Alors baiser” and “c’est douce”, to initiate sexual activity and then to fake pleasure during the act.The daughter of her mother’s best friend had told her she was going to the Ivorian city to sell body lotion. Instead, an older woman – a “madam” – who had paid for her travel without her knowledge sent her to brothels in the city every night.Sara says she is paid between 3,000–5,000 Central African Francs (CFA) – between £3.90 and £6.50 – for every man she sleeps with for a “short-time” and 25,000 CFA for an overnight stay. The money is split three ways between the brothel, Sara and the madam.Three months after arriving in Bouaké, Sara is still waiting to earn enough to pay off debts of 2.5m CFA to the madam for travel, clothes, sustenance and bribes paid to agents, and return to Nigeria.“She [the madam] took my Nigerian sim card when I came here, so I couldn’t call my people at home for the first month,” says Sara, who now goes by the name of Sugar and refused to give her real age.Trafficking is a major crisis in Nigeria, with between 750,000 and 1 million people forced into begging, prostitution, domestic servitude, armed conflict and labour exploitation.Some of those are being trafficked out of the country. Sara is one of thousands of Nigerian women and girls being exploited in the sex industry across towns and cities in Ivory Coast, according to Nigerian officials who spoke to the Guardian.The girls and women are mostly trafficked by agents who are taking advantage of record unemployment in Nigeria and operate under the guise of offering better paid work. Ten years ago, the Nigerian naira was triple the value of the CFA; today N1 equals 0.38 CFA.Due to its stable economy and prostitution being legal, although soliciting sex is not, Ivory Coast has become an attractive destination for sex work. Some victims go on to become madams who source other girls, to recoup money they spent and to regain their own freedom.Ivory Coast and neighbouring countriesAcross Nigeria, recruiting agents go into rural communities or post in jobseekers’ groups on Facebook, talking ambiguously about hustles that yield plenty of rewards and sending photographs of girls and women they have recruited to known madams.They coach recruits to tell immigration officials, who are sometimes aware of what is happening or simply don’t care enough to carry out proper scrutiny, that they are crossing the border to go to the nearby market in Cotonou, an auxiliary port for Nigeria.Many recruits say agents, who have been known to be a relative, do not accompany them on the journey but pass their numbers to other agents who guide them across the porous borders. With no means of identification, they gain access by paying bribes of 1,000-2,000 CFA, sometimes paid ahead to the driver by the agents.View image in fullscreenTiongoli is one of the small settlements in the forest where trafficked women are kept in makeshift brothels. Photograph: Eromo EgbejuleUnlike Sara, most of the women and girls trafficked from Nigeria live deep in the Ivorian jungle, far from the eyes of the law.In Tengréla, 7km (4.3 miles) from the Malian border, there are several artisanal miner’s camps used by men from Mali, Burkina Faso and Guinea to earn money before returning to their countries. Nigerian women and girls aged from about 14 to 38 also stay here in small settlements of makeshift tents made of black nylon held together with sticks.At the maquis – as the small bars are known in Francophone Africa – owned by madams in the settlements, both sets of immigrants fraternise, first publicly and then privately.“There is an odd belief in some of the gold mining regions that sex helps you find gold, which in turn [fuels] demand for sex trafficking,” says one former Nigerian official who was previously stationed in Ivory Coast. “The cocoa [production] communities also have high sex demands to keep the men satisfied.”The Guardian spoke to at least two dozen girls and women in the forest, some as young as 15. Some of them said they had been starved for refusing to work or beaten up by angry patrons. Many barely speak French and say they don’t know the country well enough to be able to escape.Nigerian officials who have managed to repatriate girls trapped and exploited in the sex industry say they have seen children as young as 13 in the interior.“A lot of the girls we found claim to be over 18 and doing sex work of their own free will, but most of the time from their physical appearance, you know they are not,” says the former Nigerian official. “Tests to determine their age, such as scanning a wisdom tooth, cost about 50,000 CFA so you have to talk to them, but if they are insistent, you let them go back.”View image in fullscreenMany trafficked girls and women work in brothels in the forest near the Malian border, used by migrant workers in mining camps. Photograph: Eromo EgbejuleIvory Coast has a law criminalising trafficking, but it is barely enforced, and the country has been criticised by the US state department for its failure to tackle the problem.A cycle of debt, sex work and cocaine: the women in west Africa caught in Europe’s drugs trailThe escadron, a notorious Ivorian police unit, has burned down some of the settlements where traffickers operate, but new ones keep springing up, partly because security personnel who come into the jungle allegedly demand weekly bribes of 1,000-2,000 CFA for each trafficked girl.View image in fullscreenGirls who have escaped at the office of a Nigerian community group in Treichville, Abidjan, Ivory Coast.

The Ivorian national police and gendarmerie did not respond to requests for comment.For Sara, the wait to return home goes on.

Chicago's Ivory Tower: The Standard Oil Building,https://classicchicagomagazine.com/chicagos-ivory-tower-the-standard-oil-building/,2024-08-24,"By Scott Holleran The Standard Oil Building: the skyscraper name evokes industry in a city once known as “the city that works.” Its original goal to propel one man’s legendary company was forged by drilling for oil in the depths of the earth and refining what comes out. Indeed, the skyscraper’s creator possessed a vision to conquer nature by constructing a beacon of steel and glass sheathed in clear, unbroken lines of marble extracted from Italy’s mountains. In its prime, terrorists marked the oil company skyscraper for death. This is the tale of Chicago’s brightest waterfront landmark. The gleam of this linear, ivory skyscraper—in contrast to the foreboding black Sears Tower and John Hancock Building—rarely gets notice, let alone respect. Thirty years ago, Chicago Tribune architecture critic Blair Kamen dismissed the Standard Oil Building as a “visual non-entity.” By 2009, the Chicago Tribune was attacking the skyscraper’s fossil fuel-based name: “Who peers up from East Randolph Drive at the shimmering white Aon Center and mourns the loss of the Standard Oil Building, or that name’s successor, the Amoco Building? No one.” Facts and the Big Idea Is that claim true? What gave rise to the building? Why is it located on the great lake? Who designed and built the solid white tower and what was the big idea? Designed by Edward Durrell Stone of New York City with  in a Sunday 1970 edition of the Tribune provides testimony that the prospective tower captured the city’s futurism. In the article, a Northwestern University professor detailed why he sought to tether Standard Oil’s rising tower to a third Chicago airport and what he saw as Chicago’s capitalist promise. Suggesting a new Chicagoland airport on farmlands 40 miles south of Chicago, Professor Stanley Berge “said the airport should be linked to the city by high-speed trains operating on the Illinois Central right of way. Trains operating at speeds similar to the metro line between New York and Washington would allow travel from the Loop to the airport in 30 minutes…[h]e cited a study which predicted the amount of passengers coming through Chicago [would] double by 1975 as evidence of the need for a third airport. “I think we have to get busy on a third airport,” [Berge] said.” The scholar argued that building a new airport far from the city which could be reached in a short time was ideal for Chicago. Citing pilot concerns about flying over Lake Michigan at low altitude in bad weather, which he said aviators thought could cause sudden air turbulence, icing and snowstorms, pilots were also concerned about disorientation while landing without landmarks and lights. Contemplating an island airport in the lake, Berge additionally pondered how that could affect circulation, lateral drift and pollution dispersion. Ultimately, according to the Tribune article, Berge forecast that airplanes could approach an island airport from three directions without passing over Chicago, which he thought would lessen the impact of noise and pollution. Northwestern’s transportation teacher argued for a new airport linked to a high-speed train along the lakeshore from Homewood to Waukegan. He said commercial properties normally located at the airport, such as hotels and cargo terminals, could be located at points along the railroad line to prevent airport traffic congestion. Berge cited property near Peotone, Illinois as ideal because the area was primarily rural and located close to the Illinois Central Railroad. This is the where the Standard Oil Building became a factor; the railroad Berge envisioned involved a tunnel under buildings along North Michigan Avenue to provide transportation for residents and workers in both the Hancock tower and the projected Standard Oil Building. Professor Berge saw the airport, fast train and skyscraper as the pipeline to feed Chicago’s industrial progress. After the Standard Oil Building was built, the vision of a third major, let alone island, airport and tunnel-based fast rail transit moving passengers to the marbled skyscraper faded. The Italian marble turned out to be an expensive problem. “Marble is weaker than limestone and granite—two other veneers that are gaining popularity as architects learn  tall, the whole, integrated structure keeps itself standing. Chicago’s Sears Tower, under construction during the same time, used a similar tubular engineering and design model. Standard Oil became Amoco in 1985. Amoco sold the tower in 1998. The building name later changed to Aon Center. This singular symbol of industrial energy, vitality and refinery in oil, art and business, was conceived and built in the name of John D.

The Kenya Wildlife Conservation Act of 2013 stipulates a maximum fine of Sh20 million or life imprisonment for convicts. The elephant tusks and a rifle recovered from the suspects in Molo on August 21, 2024. Security officers in Molo have arrested two male adults and recovered five pieces of elephant tusks and a rifle. The two suspects aged 28 and 32 years were nabbed at the Posta area near the National Bank in Molo town by officers who were on a normal routine. Police said they received an intelligence report from the residents about the suspicious characters forcing them to rush to the scene. Upon arrival at the area, the officers led by Molo police station OCS confronted the duos who were riding on a motorcycle registration number KMFE 674Z. They were in possession of two black bags, police said. Upon conducting a search in the bags, the officers found a CZ EVO 3 Scorpion Rifle loaded with 30 rounds and five pieces of elephant ivory tusks. The tusks weighed approximately 10 kilograms with its street value yet to be ascertained. Preliminary investigations, police say, reveal that the suspects were from Nakuru and were in the process of delivering them to a buyer in Molo. They are now in police custody pending a further probe into the matter before being arraigned in court. “The exhibits are kept awaiting further police action,” a police report states. Detectives handling the matter will be seeking to establish how the suspects obtained the weapon and if they are part of the gang engaged in criminal activities in the area and other towns. They will also be pursuing various leads to understand where the wildlife trophy were sourced from and its destination. “We shall also be questioning them to help us nab the buyer of the tusks,” said an officer aware of the matter. Handling wildlife trophies is a serious offence which attracts heavy penalties and lengthy jail terms thanks to the overhauled Kenya Wildlife Conservation Act of 2013, which stipulates a maximum fine of Sh20 million or life imprisonment for convicts. The Act classifies the African Elephant as an endangered species due to poaching which threatened its existence, with Kenya having led the ban on game hunting to contain the vice.Most Popular1Birth certificate in a day?

Syndicates operating within the IWT are often involved in trafficking of humans, weapons, and drugs. IWT takes place in large scale through international ports, with wildlife being smuggled inside shipping containers. Current methods to combat IWT and screen these shipping containers, such as X-ray scans, are expensive and time-consuming. Scent-detection animals present an innovative approach to combatting IWT, as animals may be better suited to distinguish between organic materials and less susceptible to visual concealment methods. Previous scent-detection work has largely focused on conservation dogs (Canis lupus familiaris). Here, we present a series of proof-of-principle studies training African giant pouched rats (Cricetomys ansorgei) to detect illegally trafficked wildlife. As initial proof-of-principle within a controlled laboratory environment, we trained rats (n=11) to detect the scent of pangolin scales (Manis spp.) and a threatened African hardwood (Dalbergia melanoxylon). In subsequent experiments, we trained these rats (n=10) to detect rhinoceros horn (family Rhinocerotidae), and elephant tusks (Loxodonta spp.). At the conclusion of these studies, rats (n=7) accurately identified all four target species (although ivory samples may have been cross-contaminated, and results should be interpreted with caution) while correctly rejecting non-target items commonly used by traffickers to conceal the presence of illicit material. Rats detected the presence of wildlife targets even when these were concealed in mixtures among non-target items. These results provide the foundation to train rats for scent-detection of illegally trafficked wildlife to combat IWT. The unique attributes of rats could allow them to complement existing screening technologies in the fight against IWT. Rats have low training and maintenance costs, flexibly work with multiple handlers, have a long lifespan, and a sophisticated sense of smell. Their small size also offers unique capabilities for the screening of shipping containers, such as being able to navigate densely packed areas or be lifted to assess contents of sealed containers by screening ventilation systems. Future directions include assessing operational feasibility of deploying rats at ports.1 IntroductionThe illegal wildlife trade (IWT) in flora and fauna is considered the fourth largest transnational crime economy, estimated to be worth between $7–23 billion U.S. dollars (USD; Zavagli, 2021). IWT is closely linked to crimes such as money laundering, corruption, and simultaneous trafficking of drugs, weapons, and/or humans (FATF, 2020; UNODC, 2020; Zavagli, 2021). Additionally, the sp logistical flexibility and training cost is cheaper than purchasing and running X-ray scanners. Nevertheless, canine units face additional limitations. Each scent-detection dog requires up to one year of training and is associated with high purchasing and maintenance costs, with some training organizations estimating between $20,000–30,000 USD per dog (King, 2013). A conservation dog requires a skilled handler who further requires training and investment, and the dog may not be easily transferrable between handlers. The efficacy of canine units is also tempered because they cannot search containers loaded onto trucks without the provision of steps to access the seal or penetrate tightly packed areas within shipping parcels. Containers stacked on top of each other further increase the distance between potential targets and the detection dog, leading to odors becoming increasingly diluted (Lazarowski et al., 2020), further reducing the ability of canines to screen additional layers of cargo.Like dogs, African giant pouched rats (Cricetomys ansorgei, henceforth rats) have been successfully deployed for scent detection work (c.f., Weetjens et al., 2009; Poling et al., 2011a, b; Ellis et al., 2017). These rats have extensive olfactory receptor repertoires and large olfactory bulbs (Freeman et al., 2020) which speaks to their ability to detect and discriminate a large variety of odors. Further, this species has an average life span between seven to nine years which makes them suitable to be trained and subsequently deployed as scent detection animals (Webb et al., 2020). The rats are adapted to the sub-Saharan climate, occurring across East and southern Africa (Olayemi et al., 2012), and can be trained to search for multiple odor targets (Webb et al., 2020).

This increase marks a significant escalation from the six cases initially reported on August 1. The National Public Hygiene Institute (INHP) has been actively monitoring the situation, with some cases and the death occurring in the country's economic capital, Abidjan. Ongoing tests aim to determine the specific strain of the virus responsible for this outbreak.Dr. Daouda Coulibaly from INHP addressed the situation, assuring that it does not currently pose a major alarm. He described the outbreak as an early-phase epidemic, noting that there is no substantial rise in the number of cases at this moment. To manage the situation effectively, health authorities are intensifying their surveillance and control measures, including identifying and isolating contacts of confirmed cases to prevent further sp severe and contagious clade 1b, which has been responsible for numerous deaths and significant concern in other regions such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, and Sweden. The World Health Organization (WHO) recently declared mpox a global public health emergency due to the severity of the clade 1b strain, which has caused over 500 deaths in DR Congo this year.In response to the outbreak, Ivory Coast is strengthening its public health measures, focusing on breaking the transmission chains of the virus and ensuring rigorous contact tracing and isolation practices.

Possession of Wildlife Trophies of Endangered Species is prohibited under Section 92(4) of the Act. Part of the ivory seized from the suspects at Kamba area, Kibwezi subcounty, Makueni county. Detectives are pursuing three suspects linked to the seizure of 84 kilogrammes of ivory in Kibwezi, Makueni county. Police said the suspects managed to escape, but their accomplice, 57, was arrested during an operation. The ambush at the Kambu area in Kibwezi subcounty was staged by a multi-agency team comprising sleuths from the DCI Serious Crime Unit and officers from the Kenya Wildlife Service. “The officers were acting on intelligence, forcing the three suspects to run away, leaving behind the suspect and animal trophies,” the DCI said in a statement. The ivory cache was wrapped in four nylon gunny bags. The suspect in custody was arraigned before the JKIA law court, where he pleaded guilty to two counts of dealing in endangered wildlife species, among other charges. “The matter is slated for mention on August 26, 2024. As the search for the escaped individuals continues, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations will not spare any resources until all are arrested and arraigned,” the DCI said. Possession of Wildlife Trophies of Endangered Species is prohibited under Section 92(4) of the Act. The ivory seizure marks a breakthrough in the fight against the sale of endangered wildlife trophies in the country which has continued relentlessly despite heightened surveillance by authorities. In the last two months alone, there have been at least seven different arrests and seizures of ivory worth millions of shillings. Police officers were among the suspects in some of the incidents. On July 18, police arrested two suspected poachers found in possession of six pieces of elephant tusks in Tigania East, Meru county. The cache weighing 18.5 kilos was wrapped in four sacks when police and Kenya Wildlife Service officers intercepted them at Muriamburi Junction Mulika area. On July 3, two other suspects, including a police officer, were charged before a Naivasha court with illegal possession and trafficking of elephant tusks worth Sh2.9 million. On Sunday, June 30, police had also arrested a villager who was found with 30 kilos of elephant tusks valued at Sh3 million in Keiyo, Elgeyo Marakwet County. His arrest brought the number of those arrested over the trafficking of ivory around that time to three and the value of the recovered tusks to Sh5.9 million. On the weekend of June 15, three police officers and a civilian were also arrested with 29 kg of tusks and 30 bullets, all worth Sh2.9 million.Most Popular1Birth certificate in a day?

'Foam fingerprinting' technique identifies animal traffickers - Liverpool John Moores University,https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/news/articles/2024/8/19/fingerprinting-for-trafficking,2024-08-19,"Forensic scientists at Liverpool John Moores University are using a unique technique to recover fingerprints from rare animals in a development which could impact the abhorrent poaching and trafficking trade. The researchers have successfully recovered ‘comparable’ fingermarks from antler, primate skull, tiger claw, bovine horn, elephant and hippo ivory, snakeskin, and tortoise shell. They also recovered mixed DNA profiles on elephant skin, ungulate fur, elephant ivory, conch shell, antler and snakeskin using the technique which employs a type of foam swab. The term fingermarks is used to describe evidential marks recovered at crime scenes which at the point of recovery, are still from an “unknown” individual. Fingerprints are normally the reference prints taken from a suspect and the “perfect” set that the crime scene fingermarks are compared against. It’s a subtle distinction and colloquially the d differently. “This is the first-time fingermark recovery has been proven possible from all the below items using the tested techniques,” said PhD researcher Alex Thomas, of the Forensic Research Institute, the largest group of specialist researchers in UK higher education. “Our findings complement existing research on elephant ivory using reduced scale powders, but we’ve shown that the opportunities for their use go beyond just cases involving ivory.” Each year, at least 20,000 African elephants are illegally killed for their tusks despite trade bans in the US, Europe, China and elsewhere. Alex, who presented the research with London Zoo at the DEFRA funded Partnership for Action Against Wildlife Crime Conference in July, is working very closely with the Metropolitan Police to translate the work into practical application by law enforcement. Alex and her supervisors Dr Nicholas Dawnay (LJMU) and Louise Gibson from London Zoo (ZSL)) used a type of foam swab for the collection of touch DNA evidence which outperformed all other tested recovery methods. She said: “We found that a single type of reduced scale fluorescent powder produced the highest average grade fingermarks in 90% of our specimen types. “This is the first-time fingermark recovery has been proven possible from this range of animal furs, skins and shells. It is also the first-time we’ve proved DNA recovery is possible from all the below items using foam swabs as a method. She says there has been some work on touch DNA recovery from deer fur, corvids, and bird of prey using swabs and mini-tapes, but the new method outperforms both. Dr Nick Dawnay said: “The beauty of this technique is it is low cost, low tech and can be carried out in the field given adequate training. Crucially, it gives us fingermarks of sufficient quality to identify an individual or a potential culprit.” The LJMU team are al than 300 crime scene examiners. Alex, Nick and collaborators recently published a review of the lack of human forensic evidence in wildlife trafficking in the journal Forensic Science international: Animals and Environments.

Later, the facility was extended to the captive elephants of the forest department. During the camp, the pachyderms are given complete rest, in addition to being provided with nutritious food. A dedicated team of veterinary doctors and other assistants from the animal husbandry department are posted to monitor the health of the animals.The petitioner stated that the last annual rejuvenation camp was organised in Feb 2021. The HR&CE department took a stand that the camp was not necessary. The temple elephants are getting all the care at the temples itself. The veterinarians monitor their diet and bathtubs for the temple elephants at a few temples were constructed.Adityan stated that the elephants in the HR&CE temples are females, which are highly social animals that need the company of other elephants for their psychological well-being. Many elephants held captive in temples and used for rides suffer from painful foot problems and leg wounds due to being chained on concrete for hours.

West and Central Africa Focolare movement celebrate 2024 Genfest In Ivory Coast,https://www.vaticannews.va/en/africa/news/2024-08/west-and-central-africa-focolare-movement-celebrate-2024-genfest.html,2024-08-19,"Emmanuel Donatus - Nigeria With feelings of joy, curiosity, anxiety, and enthusiasm, over 300 young people from 19 different countries across West and Central Africa arrived at Mariapolis Victoria, the venue of the weeklong festival, which was held under the theme “Together to Care.” From community to fraternity For the mostly young participants, preparation for the journey to Man started a few months earlier with the pre-Genfest, a series of activities organised by the Gen in their immediate community as an expression of love. These included visits to hospitals, cleaning the environment, and caring for children, among other works of charity. For Angela Neema and 7 other Gen from the Democratic Republic of Congo, it was no easy task. “it was really difficult for us at first, having to go visit people in the hospital with limited funds, but it was a really touching experience, seeing that we could be of help with the little we had.” The experience was the same for Fatima Anzaku of Nigeria and other Gen who had to do activities to raise funds for the trip to Man: “Preparing for the Genfest was very difficult for us in Nigeria because of the economic crisis. We had to encourage ourselves and find a way to do our part, as we have learnt from the Focolare. From our experiences, we have understood that we have to do our best to realise our objectives and see every obstacle as a springboard,” Fatima explained. Finta Konate, a young Ivorian living in Abidjan, was attending the festival for the first time. She said being at Genfest was an extraordinary experience. “When I arrived, I wanted to meet a lot of people from different backgrounds and cultures. At first, it appeared the people were not so enthusiastic, and I felt disappointed, but now, I leave here with rich emotions from all the love I have received,” she said. For Fabrice Afanda from Cameroon, making it to Man was a reward for their sacrifices. “It’s a really beautiful and unique experience here. Meeting new faces, seeing different cultures, and exchanging contact with each other was amazing. It was a really deep experience for me. This experience of being at the service of others, this love and humility I see here, is what I am taking home with me after the Genfest. Together to Care Addressing the participants at the opening of the regional Genfest in Man, the coordinator of the Focolare for West and Central Africa, Aurora De Oliveira, explained the choice of the theme “together to care.” She said, “Our world is suffering, there are many wars and divisions and many other sicknesses of the world, so the theme of this year is really important and timely because we need to come together to take care of humanity and to take care of the earth.” She expressed satisfaction with the turnout and participation of the young people from different countries for the Genfest, urging the young people to go and spread this message of love and human fraternity everywhere. “Humanity belongs to you. You are not only the future but also the present, so you must be protagonists. All humanity is waiting for this message of peace, of love, of unity that you have received here. Take it to the world with courage and love,” De Oliveira emphasised. Be resilient in your faith For his part, the Bishop of the Diocese of Man, Bishop Gaspard Beby Gneba, while expressing happiness to have so many young people congregating in the city of Man, encouraged them to be resilient in living out their Christian vocation. “It is easy to give up when faced with challenges, especially when it comes to giving of oneself in service. As young people, you are not just called to exist but to live, so live! Study well, but that’s not enough; you have to have values and principles of life; you have to be animated by inner ideals that transform and leave a mark on yourself and your environment to transform the Church and the world,” said the Bishop of Man. Genfest is an international interfaith youth festival for young members of the Focolare movement held every six years. It seeks to bring together young people from diverse cultures and religions to speak about love, unity, and how to build human fraternity. This year’s activities to celebrate the zonal festival at Man included Confessions and Holy Mass, meditation, cultural displays, and workshops on interreligious dialogue, ecology, peace, leadership, entrepreneurship, and living the peace. Each country also planted trees at the University of Man, led by the Regional Prefect, Soro Fatogoma, of the Prefactuere of Man.

Final treaty negotiations take place in South Korea in November.Yet most of the people who have been closely tracking the negotiations — environmentalists, tribal leaders and residents from communities hard-hit by plastic production and waste — are shut out of the talks in Bangkok. Many plastic industry representatives say they can’t get into the room either. In a series of letters to the United Nations Environment Programme, the meeting sponsor, hundreds of organizations said the closure runs counter to typical international environmental treaty-making. They said organizers have a responsibility to be transparent and allow public participation. They worry the approach in Bangkok could set a bad precedent.In earlier meetings of the UN Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on Plastic Pollution in 2022 and 2023, countries spent a lot of time debating rules and procedure, including how they would vote on decisions.This meeting of subject matter experts is the first where the substance of what could go into the treaty will be discussed in detail. It runs through next week. Negotiating committee Executive Secretary Jyoti Mathur-Filipp replied in a letter that she wasn’t authorized to let people in and countries had not agreed on having observers participate.U.N. documents only spell out member states and selected technical experts as participants.The Bangkok meeting is less formal than a treaty negotiation, she said. It is not unprecedented in U.N. treaty processes for technical experts to meet amongst themselves, Mathur-Filipp said in a written statement to the AP. That being said, she wrote, observers are important to environmental treaties and “we work very hard” for them to be able to participate.Anyone who wants to be in the room in Bangkok must either be part of a national delegation or chosen as one of two dozen invited technical experts. The two expert groups are focused on the chemicals that go into plastic products and how the treaty could be financed. The negotiating countries will then take up those reports at the fifth and final session in South Korea. In 2022, most of the world’s nations agreed to make the first legally-binding treaty on plastics pollution, including in the oceans. The goal was to complete negotiations by the end of 2024. Thousands of environmentalists, plastic industry representatives, scientists, tribal leaders, waste pickers, and others concerned about plastic pollution have traveled as observers to four continents to share their views at the prior treaty talks. The International Council of Chemical Associations hoped its scientists and engineers who develop plastic products could provide technical advice at the Bangkok meetings. Chris Jahn, ICCA secretariat, said the association is disappointed but committed to supporting the negotiation process.Many of the groups voicing concerns about the closure have advocated for a strong treaty, one that limits how much plastic is produced and eliminates toxic chemicals in plastics, rather than one that only deals with plastic waste. At such a critical stage in the process, if there are not enough people in the room in Bangkok who want a meaningful treaty, it could set the stage for a weaker document, leaders at the International Pollutants Elimination Network said.“When you get close to the end, by starting to close the door when the game is getting tougher, it could be a way to try to avoid that accountability that civil society groups bring to the table,” said Vito Buonsante, policy advisor at IPEN.In the past, observers were allowed to participate in working groups for the treaty on mercury known as the Minamata Convention, as well as in the treaty that protects human health and the environment from chemicals known as persistent organic pollutants — the Stockholm Convention.Some countries, including China and Iran, are bringing representatives from industry associations or national oil company officials as part of their delegations to Bangkok. Environmentalists, scientists, waste pickers and tribal leaders asked to join national delegations too, with some success. Uruguay, the Philippines and the Cook Islands are among the delegations that have nonprofits traveling with them. Scientists will be in Bangkok with several small island and European delegations.The Indigenous Peoples Caucus is sending one specialist for each expert group. It includes communities whose land, water and air are being contaminated as fossil fuels are extracted and plastic is manufactured using hazardous chemicals, said Frankie Orona, executive director of the Society of Native Nations in Texas, so it could not settle for less. Texas is a global leader in making petrochemicals used in plastics. “There has been so much discussion about how important it is to have Indigenous knowledge and stakeholder participation. I didn’t think it would go to this extreme, with really limited participation,” Orona said in an interview. “It’s taking away our ability to fully participate and come up with meaningful solutions.”___The Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Konan added that ongoing search and rescue efforts were 70 percent complete on Friday afternoon. Firefighters were alerted on Thursday around 1600 GMT about a ""building collapse"" at a ""mosque under construction that was holding prayer"" when ""the second floor collapsed"", he added. The Ivorian Construction, Housing and Urbanism ministry has not confirmed whether the works were legal. An unauthorised building under construction that collapsed in Abidjan in July 2023 killed six people. Another 13 victims died in two building collapses — one whose construction was underway and another that had been illegally built — in February and March 2023. : Ivory Coast adopted several measures to harden building safety monitoring.

Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility Photo Credit: Google Maps (Street View) 08/17/2024 8:00 a.m. Ivory S. Cousins, of West Deptford, NJ, allegedly ignored the inmate's significant injuries from an assault by other inmates, pepper sprayed him, helped another inmate to steal from him, and obstructed the investigation of what happened to him, according to U.S. Attorney Jacqueline C. RomeroCousins was a correctional officer employed by the Philadelphia Department of Prisons in August 2019. While on duty at the Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility, the indictment alleges that she became aware that an inmate had been assaulted by other inmates and had serious injuries, but she was deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs, failed to get him medical attention, and prevented a superior officer from discovering the inmate’s injuries, Romero said. When she later completed a report about the incident, the indictment charges that Cousins provided false information about the injured inmate being aggressive, engaging in a fight, and using a weapon.If convicted, Cousins faces a maximum possible sentence of up to 41 years imprisonment, three years of supervised release, a $1 million fine, and a $400 special assessment.The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, with assistance from the Philadelphia Department of Prisons, and is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Nancy E.

Some information may no longer be current.Save for laterPlease log in to bookmark this story.Log InCreate Free AccountCanada is a bit player in the world’s biggest art restitution story – and that’s good news.Four Canadian museums hold a total of 11 objects from the Kingdom of Benin, the historic African civilization whose art was looted by British troops in 1897 and is now scattered through Western institutions.Open this photo in gallery:The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts' Benin objects include a 19th-century commemorative head.SuppliedOne of the clearest examples of colonial theft in the museum world, the objects widely known as the Benin Bronzes are at the heart of an international campaign to document the art and negotiate its return.Restitution has been complicated, however, by disagreements over the rightful owners. Originally, the state of Nigeria, which covers the territory that was once historic Benin (not to be confused with the contemporary Republic of Benin next door), laid claim, with the agreement of the international community. This summer some support has emerged for returning the art to a descendant of the kings to whom it originally belonged, the Oba whose ownership was backed by a Nigerian presidential decree last year.For example, the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African Art in Washington transferred 29 works to Nigeria’s National Commission for Museums and Monuments in 2022. Yet, in July, an art museum at the University of Iowa confounded the museum community by deciding to give two artifacts to the current Oba, Ewuare II, a traditional ruler in Nigeria’s Edo state who was crowned in 2016.The objects take their name from the most spectacular pieces, the remarkably detailed and naturalistic plaques of human figures and life-size heads made of bronze or brass; the plaques decorated the Oba’s palace walls while the heads were commemorative portraits. However, the category also includes items made of iron, ivory and wood.The artifacts, the artistic wealth of the kingdom, were looted in 1897 after a bloody trade dispute between Britain and Benin.Founded in the 11th century, Benin was a wealthy state controlling trade on the west coast of Africa and the Niger River. In the late 19th century, Britain, which obtained palm oil and ivory from Benin and was colonizing its neighbours, forced an exclusive trade treaty on the Oba. Complaining its ums, some donated by descendants of the officers who had looted them; others purchased on the art market.However, very few items found their way to Canada.Open this photo in gallery:A 16th or 17th century brass plaque, the oldest Benin artifact in the collection of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts.Supplied“We are pretty far down the list,” said Stéphane Aquin, director at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, the largest Canadian custodian with merely five Benin items in its collection. The British Museum in London holds the largest group of all with 944 items. Montreal’s collection includes three bronze and brass pieces that typify Benin artistry. One is a plaque, about 50 centimetres high, showing a Benin courtier holding a ceremonial hammer and wearing a bowler hat of a kind adopted from Portuguese traders. It dates to the 16th or 17th century, and is the oldest and most significant of Montreal’s objects.The collection also includes an 18th-century brass staff topped by a bird and two other metal figures from the 19th century, a pendant mask and a commemorative head commissioned by one Oba after his predecessor’s death. The collection also includes a ceremonial carved ivory tusk that would have been placed with a commemorative head on an altar. The plaque, the head and the tusk are all on display in the MMFA’s galleries dedicated to global art.The Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto also has a 19th-century tusk and a wooden commemorative head, and one of the brass plaques from the palace walls, forged by the brass-makers guild in Benin and dating to the mid-16th century. Its fourth artifact is a small bronze figure of a warrior that postdates the looting.Open this photo in gallery:A late-19th century carved ivory tusk from the historic kingdom of Benin, now in the collection of the Royal Ontario Museum.Royal Ontario MuseumOpen this photo in gallery:LEFT: A brass relief plaque, dating to the mid 16th century, of the kind that covered the walls of the Oba's palace in historic Benin, now in Nigeria's Edo state. and RIGHT: A wooden commemorative head from historic Benin, dating to the 19th century. Both from the collection of the Royal Ontario Museum.Royal Ontario MuseumNone of the ROM’s objects are on display but they are listed in Digital Benin, a project run out of Hamburg’s Rothenbaum Museum of World Cultures with international and Nigerian participation. Launched in 2020, it aims to establish a complete digital catalogue of all the scattered Benin art. Currently, it lists 5,285 objects from 136 institutions in 20 countries. Only 400 objects are located in Nigeria.As well as listing their objects on Digital Benin, the ROM and the MMFA participate in the Benin dialogue group. European museums and Nigerian institutions launched the group in 2010 with the goal of seeing the objects reassembled in a museum in Benin City in Edo state. The Nigerian participation includes both its museums commission and the local Edo government but also the Royal Court of Benin. Jesus College at Cambridge became the first to restore an object, handing over a bronze cockerel to the museums commission in 2021 in a ceremony at which the Oba’s brother was present.The situation seemed relatively straightforward – the art should be returned to Nigeria via the museums commission – until 2023 when outgoing president Muhammadu Buhari published a decree stating the bronzes should be returned to Ewuare.In July, the Stanley Museum of Art at the University of Iowa caused some consternation when it returned a brass plaque and wooden altarpiece directly to Ewuare, the first U.S. institution to favour the royal claim. In an inter in 1960, but the Canadian Museum of History’s single object is an interesting one: a bronze bell with a human face using a casting technique that would date it to the 16th century and workshops outside of Benin, in the area of the lower Niger.It arrived at the Canadian museum in 1970, but it’s a good example of the way these objects can be traced back to the looting. It was collected in 1897, probably by W.D. Webster, a member of the punitive expedition, and then sold to Augustus Pitt Rivers, the British general and collector for whom the museum at Oxford University is named.

This decision concerned 176 sites considered to be at high risk of flooding which includes the neighbourhoods of Gesco, Boribana, Banco 1 and Abattoir.</p> <p>The report revealed that Ivorian authorities didn&#8217;t comply with human rights standards when conducting eviction operations. According to the Executive Director of Amnesty International Côte d’Ivoire,&#8221; the authorities have clearly failed to meet their human rights obligations including those deriving from the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), ratified by Côte d’Ivoire&#8221;. These standards include the protection of citizens from forced eviction, the prior notice of the demolition decision, the reception of fair compensation for their losses and the provision of adequate alternative housing.</p> <p>The NGO reported an excessive use of violence during the demolition of the mentioned neighbourhoods. This includes the brutalisation of people, the use of tear gas and the conduction of the destruction during an inappropriate time of the day by the police. An Ivorian resident of the neighbourhood of Gesco said that the police arrived to demolish his house at 11 PM and stayed until 2 AM, which is contrary to the <a href=""https://www.ohchr.org/en/documents/thematic-reports/basic-principles-and-guidelines-development-based-evictions-and"">African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights</a>.

Cocoa Prices Close Sharply Lower as Cocoa Production Prospects Improve,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/commodities/LSK20/pressreleases/28042895/cocoa-prices-close-sharply-lower-as-cocoa-production-prospects-improve/,2024-08-15,"September ICE NY cocoa (CCU24) on Thursday closed down -348 (-3.94%), and September ICE London cocoa #7 (CAU24) closed down -94 (-1.46%). Cocoa prices fell sharply on Thursday due to an improved outlook for the next cocoa season in West Africa. The end of the El Nino weather pattern and a potential shift to a La Nina pattern should boost precipitation in the Ivory Coast and Ghana, increasing soil moisture levels and cocoa yields. An increase in cocoa production by Cameroon, the world's fifth-largest cocoa producer, is bearish for cocoa prices. Cameroon's National Cocoa and Coffee Board reported last Wednesday that 2023/24 (Aug/July) Cameroon cocoa production rose +1.2% y/y to 266,725. Also, Nigeria, the world's sixth-largest cocoa producer, reported last Monday that Nigeria's June cocoa exports rose +18% y/y to 14.465 MT. Last Friday, NY cocoa soared to a 7-week high on concern that dry weather in West Africa could curb the region's cocoa production. Forecaster Maxar Technologies said last Friday that top cocoa-producing countries Ivory Coast and Ghana have seen a ""significant decrease in shower activity"" over the past month, leading to below-normal soil moisture and limited crop growth. Lower cocoa production in the Ivory Coast, the world's largest producer, is bullish for cocoa prices. Government data Monday showed that Ivory Coast farmers shipped 1.67 MMT of cocoa to ports from October 1 to August 11, down by -28% from the same time last year. Tighter US cocoa supplies are also supportive of prices. ICE-monitored cocoa inventories held in US ports fell to a 4-1/2 year low Thursday of 2,734,800 bags. A bearish factor for cocoa prices was the projection from Ghana's cocoa regulator on June 13 that Ghana's 2024/25 cocoa production will rebound to 700,000 MT from 425,000 MT in 2023/24 as improved weather conditions boost cocoa yields. Ghana's 2024/25 cocoa harvest begins in October. Trader Ecom Agroindustrial projects Ivory Coast cocoa production in the 2023/24 marketing year, which ends in September, will fall -21.5% y/y to an 8-year low of 1.75 MMT. Cocoa prices have been supported by better-than-expected cocoa demand. The National Confectioners Association reported on July 18 that North America Q2 cocoa grindings rose +2.2% y/y to 104,781 MT, stronger than estimates for a slight decline. Also, the Cocoa Association of Asia reported on July 18 that Asian Q2 cocoa grindings fell -1.4% y/y to 210,958 MT, a smaller decline than expectations of -2.0% y/y. The European Cocoa Association reported on July 11 that Q2 European cocoa grindings unexpectedly rose +4.1% y/y to 357,502 MT, versus expectations of a -2% y/y decline. Cocoa prices have underlying support from concern about the availability of cocoa beans for buyers. Reuters reported on June 12 that Ghana is considering delaying the delivery of up to 350,000 MT of cocoa beans to next season due to the country's poor crops. Ghana is the world's second-largest cocoa producer. Meanwhile, the Ivory Coast cocoa regulator, Le Conseil du Cafe-Cacao, announced on June 7 that companies that do not have processing plants in the Ivory Coast cannot buy cocoa beans from the Ivory Coast mid-crop until at least the end of July. The Ivory Coast cocoa regulator on July 11 at least allowed forward sales to resume for the 2024/25 cocoa crop to buyers with domestic processing plants. Cocoa prices have been supported by concerns about the West African mid-crop, which is the smaller of two annual harvests. Projections for the Ghana mid-crop, which starts in July, have been cut to 25,000 MT compared with an earlier forecast of 150,000 MT. Also, the Ivory Coast cocoa regulator said on March 7 that it expects the Ivory Coast mid-crop, which officially starts in April, to fall -33% to 400,000 MT from 600,000 MT last year. In addition, projections for Nigeria's mid-crop have been reduced to 76,500 MT from an earlier estimate of 90,000 MT. Ghana's Cocoa Board (Cocobod) said on March 25 that Ghana's 2023/24 cocoa harvest would be only 422,500 MMT to 425,000 MT, half the country's initial forecast and a 22-year low, as extreme weather and disease decimated the cocoa crop. In a bullish factor, the International Cocoa Association (ICCO) on May 31 projected a 439,000 MT cocoa deficit for 2023/24, 17% larger than its February estimate of 374,000 MT and far larger than the 74,000 MT deficit in 2022/23. ICOO projects that 2023/24 cocoa production will fall -11.7% y/y to 4.461 MMT. In addition, ICCO projects a 2023/24 global cocoa stocks/grindings ratio of a 46-year low of 27.4%.

Thai authorities seized full elephant tusks and tusk fragments originating from Nigeria destined for China worth over 15 million baht ($469,800). Abuja, Nigeria — Nigeria has launched the country's first National Elephant Action Plan. Authorities say the measure is designed to protect the small and rapidly declining population of elephants in the country. Human-caused activities, including poaching, have forced Nigerian elephants to the verge of extinction. The plan aims to save the remaining elephants by reducing illegal killings and trade, maintaining elephant habitats, creating public awareness and promoting community-led vigilance. Iziaq Adekunle Salako, Nigeria's minister of state for environment, said the National Elephant Action Plan will be a comprehensive approach to ensure the protection of wildlife. ""What we're seeing today is an upscaling of the commitment of Nigeria to ensure that our natural resources are protected and preserved,” Salako said. “We're also focusing on the host communities, because these elephants live around some people. We're going to see a situation where people can see alternative livelihoods from preservation of our elephants."" Over the last decade, Nigeria has emerged as a key source, transit and destination country for illegal wildlife trade. Elephant ivory and pangolin scales are some of the most trafficked items. The Elephant Protection Initiative Foundation said Nigeria accounts for nearly a quarter of the world's seized ivory. As a result, Nigeria's elephant population — about 300 to 400 animals — is a fourth of the population size three decades ago. Authorities say that along with the threats from poachers and habitat destruction, human-elephant conflict due to the animals’ invasion of farms is leading to  US to expel South Africa ambassador as relations deteriorate Archaeologists use song to herald findings in Guinea-Bissau dig Africa faces diabetes crisis, study finds Botswana hunting revenues almost double amid UK opposition Children being brutalized in Sudan's civil war, say UNICEF and MSF Special Report By the Numbers: Coups in Africa The Day in Photos March 13, 2025 ​",2378,True,0

The Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, which classifies the elephant as a protected species under Schedule I, strictly prohibits the trade of ivory. The global community, through the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), has also reinforced this protection by placing the Asian Elephant in Appendix I, banning all international trade of ivory since 1989.According to DRI sources, the forest department had solicited the agency’s support to catch the culprits red-handed. Acting on a tip-off, sources said, the officers of DRI initiated the operation on the outskirts of Siwan. The officers posing as decoy buyers managed to infiltrate the gang’s heavily guarded enclosure and arrested the four people, including their leader.Confirming this, Gopalganj DFO Pankaj Kumar said DRI has handed over all accused to the forest department and seized the ivories also. “We will do all formalities by Wednesday and produce all the arrested persons before the local court,” he said.Recently, DRI also arrested two persons involved in illegal smuggling of foreign-made cigarettes.

Nairobi, Kenya — Scientists and conservationists in Kenya are sounding the alarm over the killing of elephants with large tusks. According to scientists, the elephants were killed by trophy hunters in Tanzania. They say other elephants in the group are in danger if they cross into Tanzania where hunting is allowed. In a news briefing Monday, conservationists and scientists said five large-tusked elephants were targeted and killed in the last eight months by trophy hunters in Northern Tanzania. They added that only 10 of the elephants, with tusks weighing 45 kilograms (100 pounds) each, remain in Kenya's Amboseli National Park, which has the highest density of the animals. Conservationist Paula Kahumbu is the chief executive officer at Wildlife Direct. ""This is bigger than Kenya, this is bigger than Tanzania. It's actually a global issue because elephants cannot speak for themselves. We as the people of the world have to speak for these elephants. They cannot go to court; they cannot go to the east African court,"" she said. In March, Tanzanian authorities issued controversial hunting permits for the large-tusked elephants, known as “super tuskers,” in the greater Amboseli-West Kilimanjaro border area. Festus Ihwagi, a research scientist for conservation group Save the Elephants, called on Kenya to raise the issue with Tanzania.

HPS-Digitalstudio / iStock / Getty Images Why you can trust us Founded in 2005 as an Ohio-based environmental newspaper, EcoWatch is a digital platform dedicated to publishing quality, science-based content on environmental issues, causes, and solutions. Today is World Elephant Day, and conservationists have petitioned Tanzania to stop issuing permits for the trophy hunting of the gentle and intelligent pachyderms. Wild African elephants — including the “super-tuskers” who are hunted for their ivory tusks — roam freely across the border into Tanzania from Kenya’s Amboseli National Park, where their vast herds are protected from poachers. “The loss of these elephants is not just a blow to elephant populations but to our collective efforts in conservation,” said Cynthia Moss, Amboseli Trust for Elephants founder, as Reuters reported. Roughly 2,000 elephants roam the Amboseli in Kenya and Tanzania’s Enduimet Wildlife Management Area. Tanzania’s allowance of the blood sport has led to instances where hunters have killed Kenyan elephants across the border. According to conservationists, the Amboseli ecosystem has the highest density of super-tuskers who have tusks weighing close to 100 pounds, but just 10 of these great animals remain. “Hunting could cause the super-tuskers to disappear within the next three years,” the petition said, as reported by Reuters.

""The Wider World and Scrimshaw” at the New Bedford Whaling Museum in Massachusetts is telling the story through objects. Jeffrey Brown has a look for our arts and culture series, CANVAS. Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. Geoff Bennett: Scrimshaw is a traditional 19th century art form now seen through a much wider context and a contemporary lens. That's the goal of an exhibit which challenges some old assumptions about the process and the product itself. Jeffrey Brown went to the New Bedford Whaling Museum in Massachusetts to look for our arts and culture series, Canvas. It's a story of contact, impact, connections, great adventure and great loss, humans and animals across two oceans over some 100 years. In the exhibition titled The Wider World and Scrimshaw, the story is told through objects. Chief curator Naomi Slipp. Naomi Slipp, Chief Curator, New Bedford Whaling Museum: There are records of individual experiences and what those individuals were doing, whether they were in communities that were regular ports of call for whalers or whether they were whalers on shipboard themselves, they were having these extraordinary experiences. Jeffrey Brown: The romance of sea adventures, the fascination with whales themselves, it's part of the experience here. Visitors are greeted by an 8,000-pound juvenile blue whale skeleton. But, in a gallery next door, a special exhibit offers a different kind of window. Scrimshaw is the traditional art form of carving or engraving on the bones, teeth and ivory of marine mammals, typically whales and walruses. It's most associated with 19th century whaling, an industry long centered, think Herman Melville and ""Moby-Dick, here in New Bedford. The whaling museum in what's still a port city with a working harbor houses the world's largest scrimshaw collection. But, for this exhibition, it wanted to set those objects in a larger context or conversation among a wide range of works by the indigenous peoples with whom whalers came into regular contact throughout the Pacific. Slipp points to this small busk. Busks were a regular part of women's fashion in the 19th century, used to stiffen corsets and typically made from whale bone. But this one had an unusual pattern engraved into it. Naomi Slipp: And we looked at it and thought, oh, my goodness, it's a navigation chart. It's a navigation chart that's used traditionally in parts of the Pacific to learn the patterns of swells and currents to move from island to island. Jeffrey Brown: So not by the Yankee whalers, but by the people they were connecting with. Naomi Slipp: Exactly, with Pacific Islanders. And so the idea that someone who was on a whaling vessel, who was creating a busk, which is a very New England form for a corset, was also inscribing it with something that would have been really culturally significant for Pacific Islanders was quite tantalizing. Jeffrey Brown: Scholars have long studied this collision of cultures, as well as the often negative political, environmental and other consequences.

Fight against Ivory: How Indian law and activists are ending ivory trade for good,https://www.indiatoday.in/information/story/fight-against-ivory-how-indian-law-and-activists-are-ending-ivory-trade-for-good-2580893-2024-08-12,2024-08-12,"Now, let’s address the elephant in the room, or rather, the ones who are captive. Elephants in captivity often suffer from severe physical and psychological trauma due to harsh training and abuse. These elephants lose their wild spirit and can never be reintroduced to the wild. It’s a tragedy that can be avoided if we stick to the laws and protect them with the utmost care. ""As a responsible citizen of the country, it is very important to know the important laws that protect India’s elephants from brutal captivity and keep their numbers steadily growing in the wild, where they rightfully belong"", says Advocate and Animal rights activist, Niharika Kashyap. She explained that captive elephants can never be reintroduced to the wild as they are forced to lose their wild spirit after being subjected to repeated thrashings, starvation and torture to be 'controlled' by humans, all through their lives. Kashyap stated that these elephants are repeatedly beaten to be disciplined and end up with severe physical and psychological scars. The fight against Ivory: How Indian laws and activists are ending the ivory trade for good A CALL TO ACTION: PROTECTING OUR MAJESTIC GIANTS""If you encounter an elephant who is owned illegally, you can write to the State Forest Department, which has the authority to order the immediate seizure of the elephant and rehabilitate the elephant to a recognised elephant camp for long-term care and treatment. However, when an elephant is legally owned and there are reports of ill-treatment and abuse, then the Forest Officers, after inspection of the condition and a complete medical check-up, decide on the subsequent confiscation and rehabilitation of the elephant"", says Kashyap.So let’s embrace our duty as responsible citizens. Know the laws, support advocacy, and be vigilant. Together, we can make sure that the only place elephants end up being hunted is in our imagination – not in reality. Let us all hope for a future where elephants continue to roam free, their tusks shining as symbols of freedom and grace!- EndsREAD | World Elephant Day 2024: Date, history, significance, and celebrationTrending Reel",2152,True,0

From ivory towers to ebony hubs - St. Louis American,https://www.stlamerican.com/your-health-matters/from-ivory-towers-to-ebony-hubs/,2024-08-12,"Skip to content Credit: Photo via Canva American women seeking healthcare find that we are navigating a challenging path that leads to a cliff. In our current healthcare system, women’s reproductive health is hyper focused on one specific period – our prime childbearing years. But this narrow interpretation of our womanhood and of reproductive health, which is best defined for me as the condition of a person’s reproductive system during ALL life stages, exposes the inherent break down in systems’ response to our unique and evolving needs. A liberated lifetime of health and wellbeing starts in our tender years before menstruation begins and continues in the years during and after menopause. Yet, because society derives value from us for what we can produce and how much we can produce, so called, “modern” medicine and westernized healthcare system design reflects this often-fatal flaw. In my vision, ivory towers crumble and ebony community hubs of ingenuity and life force take their place. Ebony community hubs will see us in our wholeness at every stage and age; respect and integrate ancient wisdom with fresh medicine… The narrow vision of reproductive healthcare we currently experience is evidenced directly by the designation of funding and resources (or lack thereof). Across the board, medical research in women’s health is underfunded, and poignantly, research on the perimenopausal and menopausal stages of a woman’s life is under resourced and under discussed, particularly in larger studies about aging. In the limited research that does exist,Black and Hispanic women are further excluded from studies due to selection bias, even though Black women typically reach menopause earlier than white women and have worse symptoms. These inequities in research lead to inequities in diagnoses, care, and treatment options, leaving many women unable to understand the changes happening in their own bodies – and ill equipped to prepare the generations behind them. If we want healthcare that reflects the spectrum of lived experiences, the research that informs our care must be fully inclusive across these oft-overlooked periods of life.

To celebrate World Elephant Day tomorrow on August 12, we take a look at these magnificent animals in their natural habitat. The great migration of thousands of elephants, driven by an ancient instinct toward the Chobe River’s life-sustaining waters, will awe visitors this season. From May to October, the dry season draws elephant herds travelling up to 200km to the Chobe River, turning the area into a vibrant hub of wildlife activity. In turn, the Chobe National Park, home to around 120,000 elephants, becomes a sanctuary where travellers are given the opportunity to witness these majestic creatures in their natural habitat alongside buffalo, zebra, lions, leopards, and over 450 bird species.: How to have an ethical elephant encounterThis spectacle coincides with World Elephant Day , an event that brings together several elephant organisations that advocate for the mammal’s survival.Launched on August 12, 2012, by Canadian film-maker Patricia Sims and the Elephant Reintroduction Foundation of Thailand, World Elephant Day has grown into a global event supported by 100 wildlife organisations and millions of people worldwide.World Elephant Day continues to grow into a worldwide event, focused on raising awareness of the urgent issues and situation of the vulnerable African and endangered Asian elephants, advocating for stronger protections, and providing individuals with proper education on how to co-exist with the giants.Curious travellers are urged to research ethical considerations to support the conservation of wildlife and their habitats.Why help support the elephantsThe main advocacy of World Elephant Day is to protect the elephants and raise awareness on the issues they are facing.

Discover the rich and varied ways these majestic animals are celebrated globally. Saurabh Shukla Updated 12 August, 2024 8:24 AM IST World Elephant Day 2024 (Photo Source: Pexels) Every year, on August 12th, people across the globe come together to celebrate World Elephant Day. This day is dedicated to raising awareness about the critical challenges faced by elephants, from habitat loss to poaching, and to emphasize their importance in our ecosystems and cultures. Elephants are not just majestic creatures; they hold deep cultural significance across many societies, embodying wisdom, strength, and spiritual power. This blog delves into the rich cultural significance of elephants around the world, highlighting how these gentle giants have shaped human history and tradition. Elephants in African Culture: Symbols of Power and Leadership African elephants, the largest land animals on Earth, roam across 37 countries in Africa. In many African cultures, elephants are often seen as symbols of power, strength, and leadership. The elephant's large size and powerful presence have made it a natural emblem for royalty. Many African tribes view the elephant as a totem animal, representing the qualities of dignity, wisdom, and longevity. The Ashanti people of Ghana, for instance, believe that the elephant is a symbol of the king's authority, and the animal is revered in many ceremonies and rituals. South Africa includes elephant tusks in its coat of arms, symbolizing wisdom, strength, moderation, and eternity. In West Africa, the elephant is associated with the earth and fertility. The Yoruba people of Nigeria, for example, consider elephants to be the embodiment of the earth's abundance and often depict them in art and sculpture as protectors of the land. The respect for elephants is deeply ingrained in African culture, and this reverence is reflected in the many proverbs, songs, and stories that feature these magnificent creatures. Elephants in Asian Culture: Sacred Symbols of Peace and Wisdom In Asia, elephants are revered as sacred animals, symbolizing peace, wisdom, and good fortune. In Hinduism, the elephant-headed god Ganesha is one of the most worshipped deities. Ganesha is known as the remover of obstacles and the god of beginnings, and his image is everywhere in Indian culture, adorning homes, temples, and public spaces. Ganesha's elephant form represents intelligence, strength, and loyalty, qualities that are highly valued in Indian society. In Thailand, elephants are considered national symbols and have played a crucial role in the country's history and culture. The white elephant, or 'Chang Samkhan,' is particularly regarded as a symbol of royal power and is associated with the monarchy. Thai kings have historically kept white elephants as a sign of their divine right to rule, and the animal remains a potent national symbol to this day. Due to their rarity, they are highly valued and are believed to bring luck, further enhancing their importance in Thai culture. Buddhism also holds elephants in high regard, particularly the white elephant. It is said that Queen Maya, the mother of the Buddha, dreamt of a white elephant before his birth, which is interpreted as a sign of the Buddha's greatness. In many Buddhist countries, elephants are seen as symbols of patience, wisdom, and longevity, and they often appear in religious art and architecture. Elephants in European Culture: Icons of Exoticism and Nobility While elephants are not native to Europe, they have fascinated Europeans for centuries, often symbolizing exoticism and nobility. The most famous elephant in European history is probably Hanno, the pet elephant of Pope Leo X in the 16th century. Hanno was a gift from King Manuel I of Portugal, and his presence in Rome caused a sensation. The elephant became a symbol of the Pope's wealth and power, and Hanno's",4077,True,0

The complexion of this race changed dramatically at three times during the course of the evening. The first came before the horses went to the gate as Emoticon Legacy, who impressed in the first leg with a 1:55.3 victory on debut, was scratched sick from Thursday's final along with second leg runner-up Cover Band. With eight horses heading to the gate, all eyes were on 2-5 rail starter Extended Session. After the wings of the gate folded, Extended Session rolled offstride and distanced himself from the field. The complexion seriously changed for those still in contention. You Guessed It (Tyler Jones) carved out the first fractions of :27.4 and :57.1 with second choice Go Ahead Makemyday (Sylvain Filion) on his back. Filion right-lined on that 32-1 shot heading to the third station, and trotted right on by through a 1:26.2 third panel. The race, at this point, was Go Ahead Makemyday's to lose. And he did, jumping it off uncontested in the lane to squander what appeared to be an easy win. Scott Young had Tregaron in an outer path after advancing first up around the far turn, and he avoided the breaker to inherit a clear path to the wire. Southwind Caspian (Paul MacDonell) gave futile chase as Tregaron tripped the timer in a maiden-breaking 1:55.2, five lengths the best. Right Here Hanover (McClure) nabbed the show spot. ""All winter they would go out and play and run and trot and did everything.

This is the second wild elephant death due to electrocution in the Gudalur forest division in the last 10 days. The animal received a fatal electric shock while entering a banana plantation. An electric line was found entangled beneath the dead animal.The property in which the tragic incident happened belongs to one Balakrishnan, though an inspection found that he was cultivating bananas on encroached revenue land.Gudalur Divisional Forest Officer Venkatesh Prabhu and Forest Range Officer Radhakrishnan held an inspection along with the officials of the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited (TANGEDCO).Initially, the Gudalur forest division officials thought that the animal died after getting stuck in the slush. However, after the field inspection and assessing the animal’s body, Theppakkadu Elephant Camp Veterinarian K Rajesh Kumar and Gudalur Animal Husbandary Veterinarian Sugumar confirmed that it had received an electric shock.DFO Venkatesh Prabhu said that they have registered a case against the grove owner, Balakrishnan, who is absconding now,Meanwhile, TANGEDCO officials will soon submit a report on illegal power connection. “There is evidence that the animal died due to electrocution. Its internal organs, including the heart, show the impact of electric shock. The landowner used sticks to illegally draw the power line to the fence from his house. He laid the electric fence to prevent wild elephant intrusion. The animal reached the plantation in the early hours of Wednesday in search of water and food and died in the illegal fence,” DFO Prabhu said.The elephant’s tusks were removed from the carcass after postmortem. The carcass was buried at a nearby spot. A total of 43 wild elephants were killed across the state due to various reasons. Among them, four died due to electrocution. A 35-year-old tusker was electrocuted at Machinakolly road in the Gudalur forest range on July 30 after it came in contact with a live wire while trying to consume the bark of a betel nut tree..Follow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp Download the TNIE app to stay with us and",2258,True,0

This isn’t the first time my colleagues have left me speechless. Through testimonies of children seeking revenge for their murdered fathers, families losing generations due to heartbreak, communities fractured, prospects of marriage dissolved and homes forever impacted, I thought I had heard it all. But during this particular conversation with Earle Sinvula Mudabeti and Sylvester Kabajani, board members of Namibian Lives Matter, I felt my heart settle in my stomach, as I grappled with the raw realities of militarized conservation.

To  successful than conservation predicated on violence. The case of the Chobe National Park As a multiracial Black woman, I am used to being perceived as an anomaly in the conservation field. Throughout my education, I have often been part of a small handful, or the sole person, in classrooms or conferences. Hearing “are you sure you’re supposed to be here?” and seeing widened eyes when I affirmed my belonging. This outcast feeling wasn’t surprising, nor new to me.What did surprise me was that being against the killing of innocent people for conservation was considered radical. I thought I was just being human. Militarized conservation consists of hyper-vigilant security strategies to protect biodiversity, often at the expense of local communities. It could mean the use of drones, such as in Nepal’s Chitwan National Park; increased policing in national parks or protected areas such as in Cambodia; or arming environmental agents with specialized weapons as is the case in Haiti. Conservation-motivated violence is a dehumanizing way to look at poachers. I started questioning this approach after learning about the deeply rooted contestation in southern Africa between the nations of Botswana and Namibia, where bullets and elephants rumbled the communities around Chobe National Park.This park boasts the largest concentration of elephants in Botswana and  detailing the death of a mother",2241,True,0
