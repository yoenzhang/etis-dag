All Gabonese nationals, the suspects were preparing to sell six whole elephant tusks as well as seventeen pieces of ivory tips and a panther skin carefully stored in suitcases and travel bags, when they were apprehended. The total weight of the catch was around 81 kg of ivory. Curiously, the marked ivory pieces, according to the defendants, came from the seals of the Lambaréné court of first instance. With the help of two accomplices working for this court, the alleged traffickers are said to have robbed the storage warehouse of the seized ivory pieces. The success of this operation was due to the joint intervention of the judicial police, the General Directorate of Wildlife and Protected Areas (DGFAP) and the Provincial Directorate of Water and Forests, supported by Conservation Justice, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) working for the application of the wildlife law. The alleged traffickers will have to answer for the possession and attempted sale of trophies of fully protected species. They were taken into custody at the Lambaréné judicial police station pending their presentation to the Special Prosecutor’s Office in Libreville. The latter has been dealing with this type of case for the past three years, with the result that 80-90% of the ivory traffickers arrested have been sentenced to prison terms of up to 10 years for ivory trafficking. Cases of wildlife trafficking involving law enforcement officers are becoming a concern in Gabon. “These organised networks in the various types of lucrative trafficking must be firmly combated, as they can dramatically erode the rule of law by diverting certain servants of the law from their prerogatives and duties,” explains Conservation Justice in a note. The vulnerability of the storage sites for seized ivory and hunting weapons encourages ivory trafficking in Gabon. And in 2020, tips were stolen from the Lambaréné Court and tips from the Libreville Court were even seized in neighbouring Cameroon. In 2015, nearly 300 kg of ivory disappeared from the court in Oyem in the north of the country. The 2012 audit report on government ivory stocks states that ivory tusks registered at the Lambaréné court had disappeared. A year earlier in 2011, another report by the National Parks Agency revealed the disappearance of 17 ivory tusks from the Makokou court stockpile in the north-east of the country. https://www.afrik21.africa/en/gabon-the-ivory-storage-site-of-the-lambarene-court-is-the-target-of-a-burglary/",1

The May 14 seizure is one of the largest in recent years, according to Adams Cassinga, who heads Conserv Congo, an NGO that fights wildlife trafficking and which took part in the operation. The seized ivory is estimated to be worth $6 million. Authorities arrested three people, believed to be members of one of the major wildlife trafficking rings in the region. The network is linked to the smuggling of 20 metric tons of ivory in the past five years alone. The latest seizure represents more than 150 elephants killed for their tusks, Cassinga said. The tusks originated from countries in Southern Africa, which has seen a surge in ivory trafficking in the 2000s, fueled by demand from Asia, particularly China. Ivory found in a stash house in Lubumbashi, the Democratic Republic of Congo. Image courtesy of Adams Cassinga/Conserv Congo. At the height of the crisis, 30,000 elephants were being killed every year, an average of 80 a day. African elephant populations have shrunk by 80% in the past 100 years, according to an analysis by WWF. The African savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana) is considered endangered on the IUCN Red List, while the forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) is critically endangered, only a step away from being extinct in the wild. Poaching has declined in recent years, a 2021 report by Geneva-based nonprofit Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC) found. One of the factors cited for the dip is the weakening of criminal networks because of raids and arrests. “The reduced poaching seems to be the result of the dismembering through arrests and prosecutions of a large number of transnational organized criminal networks involved in ivory poaching and trafficking in East and southern Africa between 2014 and 2020,” the GI-TOC report said. The Lubumbashi raid was led by the DRC’s top conservation authority, known by its French acronym, the ICCN. It included members of the national police force, court officials and the NGO Conserv Congo. The team recovered the ivory from a stash house in Lubumbashi in the southern DRC. Traffickers brought the poached parts into the DRC from Zambia, which lies on the country’s southern border. Lubumbashi has emerged as a major hub from where poached wildlife parts are funneled out of Africa. The items originate primarily in Southern African countries like South Africa, Zimbabwe and Zambia. “We are sure it will bring a great deal of deterrence in a place where previously wildlife laws were neglected and not applied,” Cassinga said in a tweet. Weak enforcement of laws, armed conflict and corruption have allowed international gangs to operate with impunity in western and Central Africa. The DRC, which shares borders with nine countries, serves as an important transit point for the movement of trafficked parts. The Central African nation, which hosts the largest swath of Congo Basin rainforest, is also a source country for illegal wildlife goods. Yet, from 2000 to 2014, when elephant poaching was rampant, the DRC recovered only around 8 metric tons of ivory in seizures. Then, between 2015 and 2019, authorities there confiscated 20 metric tons, according to data collected by the Environmental Investigation Agency, an NGO based in the U.K. “We are making strong efforts to take down all the illegal trade networks. With time, we have bigger impacts on the illegal networks,” Olivier Mushiete, head of the ICCN, said in a phone interview with Mongabay. The Lubumbashi raid follows a series of raids in the DRC capital, Kinshasa, last year. Mushiete told Reuters at that time that they expect to recover more than 60 metric tons in future seizures. The current operation was a result of three years of investigation. “The relationship between the government and the civil society is improving. You can see that it is yielding results,” Cassinga said. He added that support from partners like Zambia-based Wildlife Crime Prevention and international donors like the Rhino Recovery Fund is helping them combat wildlife trafficking. The skull of an elephant recently killed by poachers who ripped out its tusks in Province Orientale, DRC. Ivory poaching is one of the most lucrative illicit trades, valued at around $23 billion a year, according to Bloomberg. CITES, the global convention on the wildlife trade, banned the international commercial trade in ivory in 1989. However, some countries continue to allow domestic trade and international trade, subject to varying degrees of regulation. In the past decade, efforts to curb ivory demand have gathered pace, with the U.S. imposing a near-complete ban on elephant ivory trade in 2016 and China banning the domestic trade in 2017. The EU tightened its rules on the ivory trade in 2021. Narrower exemptions limit the legal ivory trade, which conservationists say often serves as a cover for unlawful transactions. The three suspected traffickers from the Lubumbashi raid are due to appear in court this week. Even if seizures and arrests increase, the impact on poaching could be limited by countries’ failure to prosecute alleged traffickers. Coordinating cross-border investigations and amassing the necessary evidence is tricky. Wildlife crimes are often not prioritized by law enforcement agencies or judicial authorities. The arrest of two Vietnamese nationals during the seizure of 3.3 metric tons of ivory from Uganda’s capital, Kampala, in 2019 did not result in convictions; both suspects skipped bail. Raids also tend to net intermediaries but rarely lead to the capture of those who organize, fund and benefit the most from this illegal trade. “As far as dismantling the network, that is unlikely. It may be slowed down,” said Chris Morris, who works with the Kenya-based organization Saving Elephants through Education and Justice (SEEJ). “These cartels are a business.

Operation Trigger VIII, which ran from June 13 to June 19, involved some 520 law enforcement officials targeting 35 hotspots across eight African countries: Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania and Niger. More than 20,000 checks were carried out against Interpol’s global databases, resulting in the recovery of 480 firearms and 42 arrests tied to firearms offences. In addition, 14 organized crime networks were identified and dismantled. Authorities seized some 6,000 firearm parts, components, ammunition and explosives, and EUR 110,000 in cash. Reinforced border controls and surveillance once again demonstrated that organized crime groups are benefiting from a convergence of crimes and using the same routes for a number of illicit activities. An additional 78 arrests were made in connection with trafficking in illicit goods, with more than 45 tonnes seized, including more than 3 of fake medication, 1.5 tonnes of drugs (cannabis, amphetamines and opioids) and more than 10,000 litres of contraband petrol. Some 40 tonnes of fins of endangered shark species were recovered in Guinea, while authorities in the Central African Republic dismantled a network suspected of supplying poachers with firearms and ammunition. The Democratic Republic of Congo reported the seizure of 141 elephant tusks. With illicit gold mining suspected of financing terrorism and armed militant groups in the Sahel region, authorities also launched more than 85 active investigations into the links between firearms trafficking, transnational organized crime and terrorism financing. More than 26 kg of illicitly mined gold and 170 kg of explosives were seized during the operation. “In a Sahel region plagued by insecurity, I welcome the undertaking of such an operation, which contributes to the strengthening of international police cooperation, the only guarantee of success in the fight against terrorism and other forms of crime,” said Roger Ouedraogo, Director General of Burkina Faso’s National Police. Interpol Secretary General Jürgen Stock added: “Operations such as Trigger VIII underscore how firearms trafficking represents a grave transnational threat, facilitating the activities of organized crime networks and terrorist groups.” “They also highlight the connections between different types of criminality and the continued need for cooperation between countries and across regions,” added Secretary General Stock. https://english.alarabiya.net/News/world/2022/07/02/Interpol-make-arrests-seizures-in-African-clampdown-on-firearms-trafficking",1

Karthikeyani said, “We were tipped off on their whereabouts through local intelligence. Once we had their addresses, we arrested one of the accused from his home, whereas the second accused was nabbed later from the neighborhood,” said. “So far, the accused have maintained that the tusks were not obtained from a live animal. As per the information they are divulging, they found the tusks in a rocky area around their village in Hosur. However, further interrogation is on,” said a police official. Wildlife experts say that this is a clear case of poaching and there should be comprehensive inquiry into the issue. Sharath Babu, a wildlife enthusiast, said: “It is not a case of tusks collection after the animal has shed it naturally. The animal, in all probability, was shot and the tusks were harvested. Tusks that are shed naturally look different.” He further stated, “One of the tusks is larger than the other. When an elephant is shot by an untrained hunter, the animal either falls on its left or its right. So, while the tusk facing the sky can be easily harvested, the one on the ground cannot be taken out completely because of the weight of the animal.” https://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/bangalore/crime/ivory-racket-smugglers-tracked-down/articleshowprint/89782033.cms?prtpage=1",1

Questioned as soon as he was arrested, the surveyor by training tried from the outset to exonerate himself by claiming not to be the owner of the ivory found in his possession. It was only after several hours of interrogation that he cited a certain Jean-Marie Pilima, a 70-year-old Gabonese, as the person who had given him the prohibited product. The latter will be apprehended in turn in another district of the city. However, unlike his colleague Moukambi, Pilima showed good faith by driving without the slightest hesitation, the agents to the home of Mohamed Backo (Gabonese 50 years old) whom he had previously designated as the true owner of the two points. The three individuals were taken and placed in police custody in the premises of the Directorate General of Research (DGR), pending transfer to Libreville to be presented before the Public Prosecutor at the specialized formation of the Court of First Instance of Libreville.

"A Retired Italian Diplomat, Diego Marino Enrico has been arrested and is presently under detention at the Jinja Road Police Station after his house was searched and over 5 Kilograms of Ivory discovered. Diego, 79, though retired, still carries a Red Passport and a business card indicating him as a Consultant Deputy Consul General, with his address being Consulate General of Italy, 2590 Webster Street, San Francisco CA 94115.

Some of the Exhibits Upon probing, Tomusange led Police detectives and the Conservationists from NRCN to the home of the former Italian Consul, where a further house search was done, leading to the discovery of more 3.75Kgs of worked Ivory pieces. ‘’On Saturday [10/04/2021], an officer of the NCRN had received a call from a whistle blower who tipped him that there was someone in Luzira with some Kilogrammes of Ivory to sell. The Officer immediately informed Police about the development’’, added a source. The following Sunday [11/04/2021], the officers of the NRCN– Uganda, with Police, met their informer, who showed them the ivory from a hidden sack. ‘’On confirming that the items in the sack were genuine Ivory pieces, the detectives immediately introduced themselves to Tomusange and arrested him.

Tomusange led the detectives to the residence of the diplomat, where a stand-off ensued, between the detectives and the Diplomat’s caretakers, who denied access. In the ensuing struggle for access to carry out a search, the caretakers released a guard dog which bit and injured one of the detectives on the left arm, before it was eventually subdued. In his statement to Police at Bugolobi Police Station, Mr Diego Marino did not deny that he was the owner of the Ivory pieces. Nonetheless, he says he had bought them several years ago from a hawker who he hasn’t identified. “I don’t sell Ivory. I have been here for over 10 years.

One suspect was caught at the scene and is reported to be a Cameroonian arriving from Gabon and has connections to an international wildlife trafficking network according to Cameroonian officials involved in the investigation. The size of the seizure is above the 500 kg threshold considered under Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) guidelines to be indicative of organised criminal activity and thus warrants full follow up investigations. “TRAFFIC congratulates Cameroonian Customs for this important seizure, and in line with CITES guidelines, we urge the authorities to carry out thorough forensic examination of the shipment and liaise with enforcement colleagues in any other countries implicated in the trafficking to try and bring the perpetrators to justice,” said Denis Mahonghol, TRAFFIC’s Director for Central Africa. https://www.traffic.org/news/record-elephant-ivory-seizure-of-626-kg-in-cameroon/",1

On August 29 evening, frontline workers of the forest department found a carcass of a jumbo with its left tusk missing near Kattupatti tribal settlement in Sadayamparai reserve forest area in Udumalpet forest range. It was stated that the tusk was chopped off from the elephant carcass. The cause of death of the jumbo seemed mysterious. The pachyderm would have died a week ago.

A team was formed to investigate the poaching case. Shekar Kumar Niraj, principal chief conservator of forest and chief wildlife warden told TOI, “It is not proper to reveal the name of the village, from where the tusk was recovered, as it would damage the ongoing investigation.

On a tip-off, the sleuths raided Kabatabandha Square near Brahmani bridge and apprehended Pitabas Barik and Ananda Mahakud of Keonjhar district along with Ambuja Pradhan of Jajpur. ""A case has been registered under Sections 379 and 411 of IPC and Section 51 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act. The seized elephant tusks will be sent to Wildlife Institute of India in Dehradun for further examination,"" said a senior STF officer. Barik, Mahakud and Pradhan were produced before JMFC court in Chandikhol later in the day. The accused will be brought on remand to verify where the elephants were killed and their links with other criminals. Sources said India does not have a huge market for elephant tusks. Suspecting that the tusks are being smuggled to other countries, STF officers are verifying possible links of the wildlife criminals nabbed in the last six days with local and international smuggling rackets. The sleuths had received an information about a planned wildlife deal after which they conducted a surprise raid near Keonjhar RTO on February 7 and apprehended Sheikh Hasmati Ali and Chandrakant Dhal of Karanjia along with Malaya Kumar Rout of Keonjhar district's Janghira. STF officers requested the court to grant them a seven-day police remand of two accused including Ali but they were allowed three-day remand for questioning the duo. Sources said the STF, DFOs of Mayurbhanj and Keonjhar are questioning Ali and another accused whose police remand started on Thursday. Ali allegedly has links with some wildlife criminals in Kolkata as well as in Nepal. Police suspect that the elephant was probably killed in Mayurbhanj or Keonjhar and efforts are being made to ascertain all the links of the illegal trade. https://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2021/feb/13/three-held-for-smuggling-elephant-tusks-in-odishas-jajpur-district-2263486.html",1

"Agents of the National Police have intervened in Madrid 49 specimens of naturalized animals, some included within those that are of special protection in the International Agreement on Protected Species, as well as four elephant tusks, four hippopotamus tusks and two rhinoceros horns and 132 pieces of ivory. In the operation, which has been carried out in collaboration with the Madrid Municipal Police and the CITES Service (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), there is a man investigated for a continued crime of trafficking in species protected.

They were arrested on Saturday, April 16, by the elements of the provincial service of judicial police in Oyem. The operation was carried out by judicial police assisted by elements of the Ministry of Water and Forests with the support of members of the environmental protection Non-governmental Organisation (NGO), Conservation Justice. All the four persons arrested are Gabonese and had in their possession four elephant tusks, an elephant tail, three skins and five panther teeth. This constitutes an offence contrary to Article 579 of the Gabonese penal code and Article 92 and 275 of the forestry code. It is also against Article 3 of the biodiversity and ecosystems preservation principle adopted by Law Number 0002/2014 on the sustainable development of the Republic of Gabon. The four traffickers were arrested in the middle of a sales transaction. One of them, who was only identified as A.N.G. was the owner of the two skins and five panther teeth. When his house was searched, 20 ammunition were found and further investigations led to the arrest of the other members of the network of illicit traffickers. Another member of the network identified as N.N.C. is a retiree who shot the elephant and cut off the tail and removed the tusks. A search conducted in his house in Nkout village found ammunition. The accused took the security team to the scene where the elephant was shot and the skeleton of the animal was found there.  Another of the suspects, who is a teacher and identified as A.J.B. was the owner of two elephant tusks which he said he found in the forest. A search conducted in his house found no further evidence. The four risk up to 10 years imprisonment, according to the Gabonese penal code. A senior official in the country’s Ministry of Water and Forestry told HumAngle that the protection of wildlife species and the forest constitute aspects of the sustainable tourism perspective of Gabon which is a “green power” on the international scene. https://humanglemedia.com/wildlife-traffickers-arrested-in-gabon/",1

"DINDIGUL: In a two-day undercover operation, the forest department personnel in Tamil Nadu's Kodaikanal, along with the protection and vigilance wing from Chennai, arrested nine persons and seized two small tusks that they tried to sell to prospective buyers. The pair of tusks measured 52 cm each in length, 15 cm circumference and weighed 1.89 kg (0.97 and 0.92 kg, respectively). Preliminary inquiry revealed that the small tusks belonged to a sub-adult elephant and that it could have been retrieved from the carcass at least a decade ago. The tusks reached the arrested persons after being passed on to various persons over the years. The tusks will be sent to the Advanced Institute of Wildlife Conservation (AIWC), Chennai for analysis.

It was decided that the sellers would show the tusks in their possession to the prospective buyers near a Tasmac outlet at Devadhanapatti on the Periyakulam to Batlagundu road in the early hours of Sunday for the buyers to check if the tusks were original or fake ones before they could decide on buying it.

Poaching in the region is on the rise as armed criminal gangs kill elephants for tusks and rhinos for horns, which are usually shipped to Asia. As part of efforts to stop the crime, Kenya has started using high-tech surveillance equipment, including drones to track poaching gangs and keep tabs on elephants and rhinos. Parliament has also passed strict anti-poaching laws, and the government has beefed up security at parks to stop poaching, which threatens the vital tourism industry.  Kenya has special squads pursuing poachers. Regionally, Kenya has also emerged as a major transit route for ivory destined for Asian markets from eastern and central Africa. The illegal ivory trade is mostly fuelled by demand in Asia and the Middle East, where elephant tusks and rhinoceros horns are used to make ornaments and traditional medicines. https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2022-02-11-wanted-suspect-arrested-in-raid-in-joska-police-recover-ivory-bullets/ https://www.savetheelephants.org/about-elephants-2-3-2/elephant-news-post/?detail=wanted-suspect-arrested-in-raid-in-joska-police-recover-ivory-bullets-kenya",1

Simibio Kakomo and Shepherd Musiniwa were taken to the Harare Magistrates Court where they jointly appeared with Enerst Kabanda charged with unlawful possession of elephant tusks. They were not asked to plead to the charges when they appeared before magistrate Mrs Barbra Mateko, who remanded them in custody to April 20 and told them that only the High Court could grant them bail. Mr Thomas Chanakira for the State said on Monday at around 7:45am, detectives from CID Minerals, Fauna and Flora Unit Harare were told that the three were selling ivory at Total Service Station along Julius Nyerere Way. They then pretended to be potential buyers before laying a trap. The detectives met Kabanda who told them to go Kamfinsa shopping centre in Greendale where Kakomo and Musiniwa were waiting with the ivory. Kamfinsa is along Arturus Road on the way to Chikurubi. When the detectives and Kabanda arrived at Kamfinsa, Kabanda allegedly contacted Kakomo, who came in the company of Musiniwa to meet the potential buyers. They agreed to sell the ivory for US$50 a kilogramme. After reaching an agreement, Kakomo and Musiniwa went to a building and brought a greenish sleeping bag which contained the ivory. The detectives then recovered eight pieces of ivory weighing 28,35kg valued at US$4,819.50, equivalent to $703,574. https://www.herald.co.zw/parks-ranger-police-officer-found-with-ivory/",1

Port laborers who recently gathered outside the facility told a reporter that no one had ever showed up to claim the valuable cargo. ""There are 12 containers and one container consists of elephants tusks packed in sacks and some sacks loading rocks which look like marble,"" said a laborer who witnessed the seizure at the Phnom Penh Autonomous Port Container Terminal on Thursday last week. Emily Zeeberg, the U.S. Embassy spokesperson, said American officials provided information to the Cambodian Customs and Excise Department that ultimately led to the search of a sealed container and to the seizure of 1,026 cut and whole pieces of ivory weighing approximately 3,370 kilograms. ""The ivory originated from Mozambique. Cambodia is a transit hub; there is no information indicating that the ivory was intended to be sold here in Cambodia,"" she said in an email. ""The investigation is ongoing."" Ros Vanna, chairman and CEO of Kampuchea Shipping Agency and Brokers, also known as Kamsab, which grants customs clearance to foreign ships, said the port does not have rights to open the sealed containers immediately if the owner does not come. He said if goods are abandoned, a court must intervene. Sun Chhay, a director of the Customs and Excise Office at the port, told VOA Khmer that the owner of the containers apparently did not show up to claim the cargo because they feared the smuggling operation had been exposed. Chhay confirmed that the ivory was imported from Mozambique and shipped through Vietnam, where he said it was not checked because that country's customs authority does not have the rights to check transiting cargo. https://www.voanews.com/a/cambodia-investigates-3-tons-of-african-ivory-abandoned-at-port/4711512.html",1

Indeed, following a recent operation in the city of Lastourville, two new interventions coordinated by a mixed team composed of agents of the Mouila branch of the Judicial Police and those of the Provincial Directorate of Water and Forests, supported by the NGO Conservation Justice have just neutralized an alleged wildlife trafficker and two of his alleged accomplices. Two days after a similar operation in Lastourville that resulted in the arrest of an alleged trafficker, his two accomplices and the escape of a third repeat accomplice, another mixed team formed in the province of Ngounié deployed to the city of Mouila and Lébamba to carry out a joint mission to combat wildlife trafficking. This mission will give rise to two interventions that will allow the successive arrest of an entrepreneur in Mouila and two of his accomplices in Lébamba. In Mouila, the entrepreneur, who would be the broker of the group, was first arrested when He was preparing to conclude a transaction for the sale of six (6) ivory points in total, including 4 cut into eight (8) pieces. The continuation of the investigations will lead the agents of the mixed team on the trail of the one who would be the owner of the ivory points. He was arrested in Lébamba with another member of the group a few hours later. Back in Mouila and at the time of the search at the camp of the third member of the group arrested in Lébamba, the officers will discover and seize a hunting equipment including two (2) 12-gauge weapons and several large-scale hunting ammunition (458 caliber). According to information gathered from a source close to the case, the owner of the ivories would be known to the judicial police services for having been arrested and convicted for the same facts in May 2017. The three members of the group were taken into custody at the judicial police station in Mouila pending their transfer to Libreville before being presented to the special prosecutor's office. The alleged traffickers will have to answer for the facts of possession and attempted marketing of ivory. They face up to ten years in prison in accordance with the provisions of Article 388 of the Penal Code. The cases of recidivism that have emerged in these two operations challenge the actors involved in the application of wildlife legislation on the treatment of criminal sanctions imposed on ivory traffickers who continue to act after a first conviction. Three years after the strengthening of the criminal policy instituting ivory trafficking as an act of environmental crime in Gabon, these cases should know the sad application of the provisions of Article 388 to guarantee the maintenance of biodiversity, a tourism potential on which Gabon relies in its strategy of plan to accelerate the transformation planned by the government. https://7joursinfo.com/actualites/gabon-ngounie-trois-presumes-trafiquants-divoire-interpelles-a-mouila-et-a-lebamba/",1

In September this year, two men were each sentenced to eight years in jail for killing six rare tree-climbing lions. There are just over 7,900 elephants left in the wild in Uganda - these include both forest and savannah elephants. Forest elephants are categorised as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and savannah elephants are listed as endangered. The country's elephant population has been growing since the 1990s. The mammals still however face threats from poaching and trafficking. Ochiba had been sent to prison once before - in 2017 - after he was arrested with four pieces of ivory and the skin of an Okapi. Okapi are rare, zebra-like forest animals endemic only to neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-63343732",1

"Two suspects have been arrested at the Meru National Park for being in possession of five elephant tusks weighing 28 kilos with a street value of Sh2.8 million. [25,751.2 USD as of 29/04/2021]. Mr Gideon Kebati, the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) senior warden at the park said they pursued the suspects after a tip off by members of public at Kathithine area in Tharaka North sub county where they were arrested. “Our officers have been working on this information and finally caught up with them in the area known to be a hotspot for poaching. The undercover officers arrested them while in possession of the tusks,” said Mr Kebati. The suspects, who Mr Kebati said were being processed and will be arraigned in court as soon as investigations are complete, are Nicholas Kibara from Kathithine and Julius cMusili Mutemi from Mpeketoni area in Igembe North, Meru County. The suspects told investigators that they transported the tusks from Lower Imenti forest last week after being instructed by a convict, Mr Josephat Muthengi who is serving a five year jail term. Mr Muthengi was jailed by a court in Marimanti, Tharaka-Nithi county early this year [2021] after being found guilty of dealing in ivory. “Before he was jailed he had buried the tusks in the forest.

Speaking to the press in his office on Friday evening, Busia County Criminal Investigation Officer Benson Omondi said that the illegal items were recovered at Mundika area within Busia Sub County. “Early today, we received a tip-off from members of the public that there were persons in possession of elephant tusks who were searching for a buyer, so we immediately organised a contingent of officers composed of CID team, officers from Busia police station and KWS, and laid an ambush within Mundika,” he said. Omondi added that the officers also arrested four suspects who were carrying a gunny bag whose contents were later found to be 10 pieces of elephant tusks with a street value of Sh2.8 million. “The suspects have been placed in police custody pending arraignment on Monday,” he said. He urged the local residents to desist from engaging in illegitimate trade, warning that they risked being arrested. “We also urge members of the public to volunteer information, which we will use in confidence in order to secure our County,” he said. At the same time, the official said there were three other cases in court of similar nature. https://www.kenyanews.go.ke/police-recover-wildlife-trophies-worth-sh2-8-million/",1

The four were riding on a bodaboda when they were intercepted by police and Kenya Wildlife Service officials who had been tipped off. Upon searching two gunny bags they were ferrying with ten pieces of elephant tusks weighing 28 kilogrames with an estimated street value of Sh2.8 million were recovered, police said. The two men and two women said they were taking the same to a potential buyer when they were intercepted on July 29. The buyer happened to be an undercover detective who had been tipped off about the deal. Police say they are yet to know the source of the tusks. The suspects were Monday, July 31 expected in court as police investigate the source of the tusks. Elephant tusks fetch a fortune in the black market as a surge in demand for ivory in the East continues to fuel the illicit trade in elephant tusks, especially from Africa. Officials say despite a ban on the international trade in ivory, African elephants are still being poached in large numbers. As part of efforts to stop the menace, Kenya has started using high-tech surveillance equipment, including drones, to track poachers and keep tabs on elephants and rhinos. KWS and stakeholders have put in place mechanisms to eradicate all forms of wildlife crime, particularly poaching. hese mechanisms include enhanced community education, interagency collaboration, and intensive intelligence-led operations, among others. These efforts led to zero rhino poaching in Kenya in 2020-the first time in about two decades. At least 20,000 elephants are killed annually in Africa for their ivory. This translates to 55 elephants killed daily or one elephant killed every 26 minutes with a population of 35,000 elephants. On April 30, 2016, Kenya set ablaze 105 tonnes of elephant ivory and 1.35 tonnes of rhino horn. Former President Uhuru Kenyatta led world leaders and conservationists in burning the remains of 6,500 elephants and 450 rhinos killed for their tusks and horn. Parliament has also passed strict anti-poaching laws and the government has beefed up security at parks to stop poaching, which threatens the vital tourism industry. Regionally, Kenya has also emerged as a major transit route for ivory destined for Asian markets from eastern and central Africa. The illegal ivory trade is mostly fuelled by demand in Asia and the Middle East, where elephant tusks and rhino horns are used to make ornaments and traditional medicines. https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/realtime/2023-07-31-four-arrested-elephant-tusks-worth-sh28m-found-in-busia/",1

"Two of the Democratic Republic of Congo’s most prolific wildlife traders have been handed jail terms this year, in a rare spell of conservation wins for Congolese law enforcement. Salomon Mpay 51, was arrested at a Kinshasa hotel on Jan. 30, following a two-year joint investigation between the Congolese Institute for the Conservation of Nature (ICCN) and Conserv Congo, a Kinshasa-based not-for-profit. Mpay, who goes by the pseudonym of “The King,” was caught with 35 kilograms (77 pounds) of cut-up ivory, which he intended to sell to an undercover agent posing as a client. He was also in possession of almost 2.5 metric tons of pangolin scales. However, delays in issuing a search warrant following his arrest meant accomplices had time to move the contraband before the authorities could return to seize the goods. Photos on his cellphone indicated a further ivory stockpile of 3 metric tons kept at an undisclosed location",https://news.mongabay.com/2021/05/tale-of-two-traffickers-is-a-rare-spell-of-congolese-conservation-convictions/,"investigators are actively looking for the items. Similar quantities of pangolin scales and ivory have sold for as much as $8 million and $6 million, respectively. On April 22 [2021], Gombe Magistrates Court in Kinshasa, the capital, sentenced Mpay to two years in prison. While Mpay’s arrest has been hailed by conservationists as a rare victory in the fight against the illegal wildlife trade in DRC, lawyers acting on behalf of ICCN, the state-run wildlife authority, and Conserv Congo have lodged an appeal, through the public prosecutor’s office, describing the sentence as unduly lenient for a transnational wildlife trafficker whose career spans three decades. “He is one of the few local traders that I know of who has got a passport full of stamps — mainly in Africa,” Conserv Congo founder Adams Cassinga told Mongabay. Mpay is linked to a number of traffickers across the continent, including in Zambia, Uganda, Burundi, South Sudan, Central African Republic, Angola, Republic of Congo, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. Documents in his possession at the time of his arrest attested to his dealings with people in Southeast Asia, where he is known to have sent multiple consignments of wildlife contraband. “He is a major link. A network is a chain of people, you can cut the link — his conviction won’t affect the trade, per se, but it will affect the organization,” Cassinga added.

"Two of the Democratic Republic of Congo’s most prolific wildlife traders have been handed jail terms this year, in a rare spell of conservation wins for Congolese law enforcement. Salomon Mpay 51, was arrested at a Kinshasa hotel on Jan. 30, following a two-year joint investigation between the Congolese Institute for the Conservation of Nature (ICCN) and Conserv Congo, a Kinshasa-based not-for-profit. Mpay, who goes by the pseudonym of “The King,” was caught with 35 kilograms (77 pounds) of cut-up ivory, which he intended to sell to an undercover agent posing as a client. He was also in possession of almost 2.5 metric tons of pangolin scales. However, delays in issuing a search warrant following his arrest meant accomplices had time to move the contraband before the authorities could return to seize the goods. Photos on his cellphone indicated a further ivory stockpile of 3 metric tons kept at an undisclosed location",https://rhinoreview.org/tale-of-two-traffickers-is-a-rare-spell-of-congolese-conservation-convictions/,"investigators are actively looking for the items. Similar quantities of pangolin scales and ivory have sold for as much as $8 million and $6 million, respectively. On April 22 [2021], Gombe Magistrates Court in Kinshasa, the capital, sentenced Mpay to two years in prison. While Mpay’s arrest has been hailed by conservationists as a rare victory in the fight against the illegal wildlife trade in DRC, lawyers acting on behalf of ICCN, the state-run wildlife authority, and Conserv Congo have lodged an appeal, through the public prosecutor’s office, describing the sentence as unduly lenient for a transnational wildlife trafficker whose career spans three decades. “He is one of the few local traders that I know of who has got a passport full of stamps — mainly in Africa,” Conserv Congo founder Adams Cassinga told Mongabay.

"An adjutant of the national gendarmerie and a sergeant of the Congolese armed forces were arrested for ivory trafficking (illegal possession of ivory tusks) during an operation which saw the dismantling of a network of suspected ivory traffickers. Four civilians, members of this network, were also arrested during an operation carried out by elements of the National Gendarmerie. The six alleged traffickers who make up the network were arrested successively on January 27, 28, 31 and February 2, 2021 in Pointe-Noire, the economic capital of the Republic of Congo. This series of arrests was carried out with the support of agents from the Departmental Directorate of Forest Economy of Pointe Noire and PALF (Support Project for the Application of the Law on Wildlife). This punch operation allowed the seizure of four (4) ivory tusks, weighing 101.3 kg, representing approximately four (4) slaughtered elephants, several objects worked in ivory namely 20 sticks, 15 pendants, 04 round bracelets, 02 chopsticks with balls. Initially, four individuals were arrested, including two on 27 January [2021] and the other two on 28 January 2021 with an ivory tusk. The investigations into this case led to the arrest of two other members of this network. The adjutant was arrested on January 31, 2021 with two (2) ivory tusks and the sergeant arrested with an ivory tusk on February 2, 2021. This soldier of the Congolese armed forces confessed to having used his service weapon to shoot down an elephant in the forest of the district of Banda in the Department of Niari. The other five are being prosecuted for the offenses of illegal possession, circulation and marketing of the seized ivory tusks. Note that the arrested gendarme is also a sculptor and sells products worked in ivory. These alleged wildlife offenders, all of Congolese nationality, have all admitted the facts with which they are accused. They are said to be familiar with the illegal trade in wildlife products in the town of Pointe Noire. The ivory seized is believed to come from the villages of Konongo in the Department of Kouilou and Ngokosso in the District of Banda, Department of Niari. The latter will answer for their acts before the Congolese justice and risk sentences of up to five years of imprisonment and 5 million FCFA in fines, each. The illegal trade in wildlife products is leading to the extinction of wildlife species around the world. This illegal trafficking is the third most profitable form of trade after drugs and weapons. Recall that the elephant enjoys absolute protection in the Republic of the Congo following the 1991 decree as well as an act of the Sovereign National Conference. The species is threatened with extinction in many places in Congo due to poaching for its spikes. Article 27 of the Congolese law on the protection of this wildlife species states: ""the importation",https://groupecongomedias.com/demantelement-dun-reseau-majeur-de-presumes-trafiquants-divoire-a-pointe-noire-un-adjudant-et-un-sergent-aux-arrets/?fbclid=IwAR18k39kcTINRmCzSCLMduzoSGfVka97rFqbbjlh2rn8KCDhYs5b84-pU8g,export; the detention and transit on national territory of fully protected species; as well as their trophies are strictly prohibited; except special dispensation from the water and forestry administration; for the needs of scientific research ”.,https://groupecongomedias.com/demantelement-dun-reseau-majeur-de-presumes-trafiquants-divoire-a-pointe-noire-un-adjudant-et-un-sergent-aux-arrets/?fbclid=IwAR18k39kcTINRmCzSCLMduzoSGfVka97rFqbbjlh2rn8KCDhYs5b84-pU8g,1

Samuel Adama, 28, is a Ghanaian national. The team of conservationists, made up of agents of the judicial police (PJ) branch of the province of Nyanga (south-east Gabon) and agents of the provincial directorate of the same service, supported by the NGO Conservation Justice, surprised him in a motel room, a place more used by traffickers. He had in his possession an ivory point of about 22kg, cut into three pieces. At the origin of this important operation, reliable information reached the agents evoking the detention and marketing in progress of an ivory point in a motel in the city of Tchibanga. In Nyanga province, not a month goes by without a case of wildlife trafficking. When questioned, the offender was not asked to denounce one of his accomplices, Yves Kevin Mihindou, a 31-year-old Gabonese. The latter will eventually be apprehended a few hours later, thanks to the tenacity of the police and members of the NGO Conservation Justice. He will admit that his dirty work was organized with two other accomplices. The two other accomplices wanted by the police were finally apprehended in turn on June 17 while they were in the village in the region of Dubinda-forest where the accomplices usually conduct their hunting party. They are Cédric Moundounga and Lewis Mouketou, two Gabonese aged 31 and 25 respectively. The four offenders are currently in police custody at the PJ premises pending further proceedings.

He slowly and confidently walked away from the scene but was quickly recognized, stopped and arrested alongside the others. The two ivory tusks were unusually big and weighed over 50kg indicating they were cut from a big elephant, something which is not very common today. Elephant tusks weighing over 20kg are difficult to find nowadays and some experts suggest this could be the result of intense poaching of elephant in the sub region with individuals in the various herds not allowed to grow to big enough sizes or are simply shot dead before they attain their full size. They also say this is also an indication of the fact that the elephant would have been killed in the savanna region because forest elephants have smaller ivory sizes. http://www.laga-enforcement.org/en/5-men-including-the-son-of-a-former-minister-have-been-arrested-with-two-huge-ivory-tusks-in-yaounde-A",1

The ivory seized is said to be of African origin and weighs about 323.7 kilograms in total. The suspects were attempting to smuggle the illegal animal parts from Hong Kong into the Chinese mainland. The suspects, which include six Hong Kong residents, have now been detained for further investigation, according to China Daily. Shenzhen Customs described this as a ‘major ivory-smuggling case’ and said that they became aware of the group’s presence in 2017, when a similar case was being investigated in Zhanjiang, another city in Guangdong. The group had been using highly stealthy and sophisticated communication lines during their operation, making the case a hard nut to crack. Although customs agents teamed up with police from multiple cities, including Shenzhen, Maoming, Zhuhai, Fuzhou and Hong Kong, it wasn’t until this July, after two raids were carried out, that the joint police force managed to seal off this smuggling channel. https://www.thatsmags.com/shenzhen/post/25809/shenzhen-customs-busts-gang-of-ivory-smugglers",1

"Federal authorities revealed Wednesday [02/01/2019] that they raided the home of an Oakdale couple in December and confiscated a variety of rhinoceros and elephant parts that the pair claimed they had collected as family heirlooms. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service launched the investigation in 2016, and it led to a search on Dec. 12 [2018] of a home in the 4700 block of Helmo Avenue occupied by Chang Xiong and his wife, Ma Chang. Search warrant documents unsealed Wednesday [02/01/2019] in federal court in St. Paul show that investigators seized seven rhino feet, five rhino toenails, a rhino horn and two wine cups, two walking stick handles, a snuff bottle and a ring, all made from rhino parts. They also seized a carved elephant tusk, an ivory figurine and two bracelets and a ring. Neither Xiong nor Chang has been charged with a crime. Darin Brandenburg, a special agent with the wildlife service based in Madison, Wis., outlined the investigation in a statement to support the warrant. Brandenburg wrote that it began May 11, 2016, when a source who runs a taxidermy business in the United Kingdom sent U.S. authorities an e-mail indicating that Xiong had tried to buy a rhinoceros foot. He said the source explained to Xiong that it would be illegal to ship the foot to the U.S., but he sent him Brandenburg’s covert e-mail address, indicting that he might be able to help. Brandenburg said Xiong sent him an e-mail looking for rhino feet and continued his pursuit of the contraband even after being told that they had to be careful to avoid getting into trouble. Xiong said he had bought a rhino foot in April 2016 from a seller in Florida without any trouble. They eventually agreed to meet at a Home Depot parking lot in Hudson, Wis., to make a deal. Xiong and Chang arrived at the lot in July 2016 in a black Mercedes, Brandenburg said. After Chang inspected a rhino foot that was secretly marked with “fluorescent invisible detection paste,” Xiong paid Brandenburg $1,100. State and federal investigators followed the couple back to their home in the 1900 block of Montana Avenue E. in St. Paul, where they lived at the time, and watched them unload the foot. In November 2016, Customs and Border Protection agents intercepted a 24-pound shipment of elephant toenails, bone and two small unidentified animal horns. They released the shipment and it was delivered to Xiong at his St. Paul address. He arranged another covert sale to Xiong of a rhinoceros foot for $1,100 in September 2017. “Xiong inspected the foot and said he was going to display it in his house,” Brandenburg wrote. “I asked Xiong how many rhinoceros feet he had now. Xiong replied saying he only had the two he had bought from me. … Chang said she had eight relatives so she wanted me to find a rhinoceros foot for each of them. Chang also said she wanted a rhinoceros foot for each of her four children.”  Chang, who is from Thailand, explained that rhinoceros parts are good luck. Xiong immigrated to the U.S. more than 20 years ago from Laos. In the Hmong culture, Brandenburg wrote, “rhinoceros parts and elephant ivory are symbols of wealth and prosperity.”  Authorities inspected a package shipped to Xiong from the United Kingdom in January 2018 that contained a rhinoceros foot.  Brandenburg said he arranged another sale of two more rhinoceros feet in December for $1,600.  In addition, he said, Xiong bought an elephant tusk through a Canadian auction firm and it was shipped to him with a customs form declaring it as plastic.",http://www.startribune.com/feds-seize-rhinoceros-elephant-parts-from-oakdale-home/503867462/,,"Federal authorities revealed Wednesday [02/01/2019] that they raided the home of an Oakdale couple in December and confiscated a variety of rhinoceros and elephant parts that the pair claimed they had collected as family heirlooms.

About 12 kilos of Elephant tusks and five pieces of Tiger teeth - cumulatively valued at Rs 1.147 crores - were recovered and seized. Three persons were arrested. The recovery and seizure coincided with the Global Tiger Day. DRI had learnt that a Kolkata-based syndicate headed by a man called Habibullah is smuggling Elephant tusks, ivory articles, Tiger teeth and other animal parts out of India and to various countries like Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar. The export of animal body parts are prohibited for export under the provisions of Foreign Trade Policy, Customs Act, 1962 read with Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. Acting on the intelligence, DRI sleuths intercepted Muslima Begum, second wife of Habibullah on Sunday at Sealdah Railway Station with two pieces of Elephant tusks weighing 4.27 kilograms which she had brought from Assam, concealed inside her side bag, under the instructions of her husband. She was about to hand over the same to her husband at the station itself. Immediate interrogation of the husband-wife duo and quick follow-up actions by DRI resulted in recovery of one piece of ivory bangle and another ivory piece from the flat of their son-in-law Adil Hussain in Park Circus area along with five pieces of Tiger teeth and 29 pieces of assorted ivory and some mechanical instruments along with Rs 1,48,000 in cash. https://zeenews.india.com/kolkata/syndicate-smuggling-animal-body-parts-busted-in-kolkata-tusks-and-tiger-teeth-recovered-2223428.html.",1

Neither Likwema nor his accomplices were immediately reachable for comment. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tanzania-poaching/tanzania-seizes-ivory-tusks-equivalent-to-117-elephants-killed-idUSKCN1VQ13V https://nypost.com/2019/09/05/tanzania-seizes-ivory-tusks-equivalent-to-killing-117-elephants/ https://www.mwananchi.co.tz/habari/kitaifa/Vipande-338--vya-meno-ya-tembo-vyakamatwa-Dar-/1597296-5260894-3k73bnz/index.html https://twitter.com/HKigwangalla/status/1169536186521702401",1

Forest Department officials said on Saturday, 16 December, that the ivory carvers — migrants from south and central Kerala —  were under surveillance. Several such carvers had migrated to Karnataka between 2015 and 2017, they added. “It is their traditional occupation. They came on our radar and we started arresting those involved in the illegal ivory carving business,” a senior forest official told South First. “Migrants from Kerala in and around Mysuru were initially into wood-carving. Since huge money is involved in ivory carving, they established a network of agents in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, who supplied them with ivory,” said the officer. “They mostly carved idols of gods, which were in high demand in North India. Families in North India offer ivory idols of Hindu gods as dowry so that they are passed on to the next generations,” he explained. Pasha, who supplied ivory to artisans, had been under the Karnataka Forest CID’s surveillance. The officials had information that he was dealing with ivory artefacts worth lakhs of rupees. They also learnt that Asghar was in touch with Sibi in Kerala. In the first week of December, Karnataka and Kerala forest departments conducted a joint sting operation and sent a decoy as a customer to Sibi’s house to buy an ivory artefact. Subsequently, four men were arrested, while Anil escaped. However, a special investigation team of the Kerala Forest Department arrested him from his house and seized two country-made muzzleloaders from him. Officials in the search party said Sibi’s house looked like a blacksmith or a gunsmith’s workshop. The trophies seized from Sibi’s house were sent for forensic examination. Meanwhile, an NIA team might visit Attappadi following the seizure of firearms and ammunition. https://thesouthfirst.com/karnataka/karnataka-kerala-forest-departments-bust-interstate-illegal-ivory-smuggling-racket-operating-from-attappadi/",1

Mmegi,https://www.mmegi.bw/news/trio-charged-with-elephant-tusk-possession/news,2023-10-16,"Three men made a court appearance on Friday for a Case Management Conference (CMC) regarding the alleged possession of an elephant tusk. According to the charge sheet, Thusego Masisi, 34, Onneetse Molefhe, 34, and Maxwell Fanikiso, 37, were allegedly found in possession of a 12.6 kg elephant tusk near Nzano Mall in Francistown on March 27, 2020. The charge specifies that they had no permit or licence for the possession of the tusk, which was being transported in a BWM car with registration B 239 BEM and valued at P24,000. During the court proceedings, Masisi's attorney, Mongiwethu Nehwati, conveyed that her client, upon arrest, had the chance to inspect the tusk at the police station. At that time, it was broken but not cut at its tip, as it is currently presented in court. In response, Molefhe stated he had nothing to add, while Fanikiso echoed Masisi's sentiments. Meanwhile, when the court went to Kutlwano Police Station for an inspection in loco (to enable the cort to observe real evidence in addition to oral evidence), Nehwati reminded the court that a previous order granted the car owner teh right to possess but not sell the vehicle until the conclusion of the case. As per the law, if it's proven beyond reasonable doubt that the BMW was unlawfully transporting the tusk, it will be forfeited to the state. The trio is scheduled to appear in court on February 1, 2024, for the continuation of the trial before Principal Magistrate Tshepo Magetse. https://www.mmegi.bw/news/trio-charged-with-elephant-tusk-possession/news",1

"The Mpwapwa District Principal Magistrate’s Court in Dodoma Region has sentenced Pastor Sekandi Mkombola to 20 years in jail after finding him guilty of possessing government trophies and committing an economic sabotage crime. The magistrate of the District Principal Magistrate’s Court, Ms Nurupudensia Nassary, issued the sentence last Thursday saying the court had been satisfied with evidence submitted before it. Magistrate Nassary said following evidence produced before the court, the suspect has been convicted beyond reasonable doubt. “After you have been found guilty, the court is sentencing you to 20 years jail. However, the door is open for appeal within 30 days for the side which is not satisfied by the ruling,” she said. Mkombola, who is a pastor with the Anglican Church Tanzania, was arrested on October 26, last year in Mingui Village allegedly in possession of two elephant tusks worth Sh69.15 million. Reading the charge sheet earlier, Police Public Prosecutor Wilson Mwita told the court that the suspect was charged with two counts of possessing government trophies and economic sabotage. He demanded before the court that the suspect committed the offence contrary to Section 86 (i)(ii) of the Wildlife Conservation Act Cap 5 of 2009 and Article 14 (d) table 57 (1) of economic sabotage as revised in 2002. Mr Mwita prayed the court to issue stern punishment in order to server as a lesson to servants of God and general public that engage in such illegal dealings.

The magistrate of the District Principal Magistrate’s Court, Ms Nurupudensia Nassary, issued the sentence last Thursday saying the court had been satisfied with evidence submitted before it. Magistrate Nassary said following evidence produced before the court, the suspect has been convicted beyond reasonable doubt. “After you have been found guilty, the court is sentencing you to 20 years jail. However, the door is open for appeal within 30 days for the side which is not satisfied by the ruling,” she said. Mkombola, who is a pastor with the Anglican Church Tanzania, was arrested on October 26, last year in Mingui Village allegedly in possession of two elephant tusks worth Sh69.15 million. Reading the charge sheet earlier, Police Public Prosecutor Wilson Mwita told the court that the suspect was charged with two counts of possessing government trophies and economic sabotage. He demanded before the court that the suspect committed the offence contrary to Section 86 (i)(ii) of the Wildlife Conservation Act Cap 5 of 2009 and Article 14 (d) table 57 (1) of economic sabotage as revised in 2002. Mr Mwita prayed the court to issue stern punishment in order to server as a lesson to servants of God and general public that engage in such illegal dealings. However, defence lawyer Sostenes Mseligwa asked the court to reduce the punishment to his client because it was the first time he committed the offence.

Three persons, all ivory traders, were arrested in this connection. According to reports, the officials, acting on a tip-off about the smuggling of the tusks in the car, chased the vehicle and intercepted it near Bayapita village. On searching the car, the tusks were recovered from the vehicle. The accused were being questioned to ascertain the possible involvement of others in the offence. According to Dr Biswajit Mohanty, an eminent wildlife activist, poachers are indulging in mindless killing of tuskers in the state to extract their teeth. The state government, on the other hand, has not been able to contain such ghastly act because of inadequate focus on the grave issue. “Despite Odisha being criticised outside for the rising number of elephant deaths, mostly tuskers, the state forest department has not been able to crack down the poachers and traders. Unless the state government wakes up to nail the poachers, the elephant population here will cease to exist,” said Dr Mohanty. Although the state government is arresting poachers from time to time, the killers are being acquitted due to the weak investigation process by the forest officials. Dr Mohanty, who is secretary of Wildlife Society of Odisha, urged the state government to hand over the arrested poachers to the Special Task Force for an effective probe. Of the 784 elephant deaths in Odisha in the last 10 years and four months, 114 were killed by poachers, primarily for Ivory. https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/crime/020920/19-kg-elephant-tusks-seized-in-odishas-keonjhar-3-traders-held.html",1

Magistrate Shaidi granted bail to the duo on condition of securing two reliable sureties each and that every surety must have an identification letter and sign bond of 5m/- [2,153.91 USD as of 03/29/2021]. One of the sureties, according to the magistrate, must surrender in court a title deed of immovable property worth of such amount. None of them managed to meet the bail conditions. On part of Seif and Mpalupalu, Magistrate Chaungu directed them to seek bail to the High Court if they so wished because his court lacked jurisdiction as the amount involved exceeds 10m/- [4,307.83 USD as of 03/29/2021]. Under such circumstances, all accused persons were ordered to go to remand and the two cases were adjourned to April 13, 2021 for mention, pending further investigations into the matters. https://dailynews.co.tz/news/2021-03-29606213667d715.aspx https://allafrica.com/stories/202103300681.html#:~:text=FOUR%20people%20appeared%20before%20the%20Kisutu%20Resident%20Magistrate%27s,which%20are%20government%20trophies%2C%20valued%20at%20over%20180m%2F-.",1

"The dead body of a sub adult tusker with both its tusks missing was found in Balumath jungles of Latehar district resulting in widespread anger. Kumar Ashish, conservator of Palamu forest has confirmed the death of the tusker and claimed that both its tusks were missing. Ashish said the tusker was found dead last night itself and the officials were combing the area. The site of the death is in Renchi, the protected forest of Balumath in Latehar district which also falls close to the district of Chatra. Notably, it was the same tusker that was earlier found limping and had undergone a long treatment on its left hind leg. Touring veterinary officer Dr Ajay Kumar was specially brought down to the jungles of Renchi from Bokaro for his treatment under orders of the state government. Sources said Dr Ajay Kumar did his best and the tusker began to recover fast but now it is dead and both its tusks missing. This point showcases that the tusker was killed by poachers for its tusks. However, officials have claimed that they are not sure whether the tusker was killed for its tusks or was it after its death that the tusks were removed. A lagatar24.com correspondent spoke to one of the doctors, Dr V S Dubey, also a 2012 batch IFS officer, who performed the post-mortem on Sunday. Dr Dubey said the tusker had no external injury or wound. There were no scars or holes in its body. Explaining the reason for its demise, Dr Dubey said, “There was definitely internal injury. It was severe. There was a pool of blood inside the body.” The internal injury was near the mammary glands of the tusker. The bleeding was very profuse, Dr Dubey added. He said the tusker had a deformity of the leg. Its left hind leg was shorter than its right hind leg. Dr Dubey further added that the left hind leg was shorter by 3 inches. Dr Dubey feared that the serious internal bleeding might have led the tusker to go into shock that led to its death. Conservator Ashish said, “The poachers removed the tusks after the elephant’s death. The location where this elephant was found dead is beyond the territory of the PTR.

"On May 3 [2021], the Federal Police of São Paulo took to the streets to carry out search and seizure warrants. The targets of Operation Airâvata (named after an elephant god in Hindu mythology) were investigated for international trafficking in elephant ivory. Police found more than 200 ivory objects and about 35 fossils in an antique store. The PF action took place in partnership with the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama) and the Environmental Police of the State of São Paulo. This operation was an offshoot of Operation Thunder last year. IBAMA identified among the pieces found those that are the teeth of wild animals, such as elephant ivory. No crude parts were found, but objects such as necklaces, bracelets, pendants and statues. The authorities estimate that the added value of the pieces found exceeds R$ 500 thousand. Brazil is a signatory to an international treaty that prohibits the sale of endangered animals. In this case, Asian and African elephants. Due to trafficking, pieces that use ivory need to be accompanied by specific documentation proving that the material used has a regular origin. None of the parts found by the PF had the required paperwork. Combating ivory trafficking is an extremely important environmental action. According to the head of the Federal Police's Crimes Against the Environment Precinct, Sebastião Pujol, the illegal trade in parts that use elephant teeth leads to the extermination of hundreds of animals a day for profit from the sale of parts. Ibama fined the violators at R$5,000 per item found. The operation targeted a commercial establishment and a residence of the same person, a merchant who has a shop selling semi precious stones and antiques in general. In addition, the investigated man has an activity in the educational area. There was no arrest in the act. During the press conference, when asked if the products were being marketed as if it were something “normal”, the delegate implied that they were. “It would be good for people to be aware that the end consumer is collaborating directly with a chain of commerce that results from the slaughter of animals that are endangered, which are elephants,” he says.

(FOX 5 DC) - A Fredericksburg man pleaded guilty to the sale of elephant and whale ivory. According to court documents, Gary L. Cooper, 60, was using online storefronts from June 2015 to early 2020 to sell elephant and whale ivory, which was in violation of the Endangered Species Act. Officials say Cooper used Craigslist and eBay to sell individual carvings made from ivory. The items ranged in size, including two raw elephant tusks that measured at least 28 inches long. In addition to several raw and carved tusks, the advertisements offered numerous elephant ivory carvings and both raw and scrimshawed sperm whale teeth. Cooper told purchasers, including an undercover agent, that he was selling off an estate belonging to an elderly couple in poor health, when he was really buying ivory online and flipping the pieces. Officials say for about 16 months, beginning in September 2018, Cooper did business with United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) undercover agents by selling or offering about 50 pieces of elephant ivory, valued between $40,000 and $95,000. On November 17, 2018, Cooper offered to sell to an undercover USFWS Special Agent multiple ivory pieces for a total cost of $8,125. On November 26, 2018, he also sold two pieces of carved elephant ivory to the undercover agent and mailed the items from Virginia to New York. Forensics confirmed that it is genuine elephant ivory. Cooper is scheduled to be sentenced on August 31 and has turned over about 136 pieces of raw and carved ivory. He faces a maximum of one year in prison.

According to court documents, Gary L. Cooper, 60, operated online storefronts to sell elephant and whale ivory, all in violation of the Endangered Species Act. From at least June 2015 through early 2020, Cooper used online platforms, such as Craigslist and eBay, to list for sale individual carvings made in whole, or in part, from ivory. These items ranged in size, including two raw elephant tusks that measured at least 28 inches long. In addition to several raw and carved tusks, the advertisements offered numerous elephant ivory carvings and both raw and scrimshawed sperm whale teeth. Cooper told his clients, including an undercover agent, that he was selling off an estate belonging to an elderly couple in poor health, when in reality he was regularly buying ivory online and flipping the pieces for profit. Over about a sixteen-month period beginning in September 2018, Cooper did business with United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) undercover agents by selling or offering for sale no less than 50 pieces of elephant ivory, with a total market value between $40,000 and $95,000. During their correspondence, Cooper and the undercover agents discussed the illegality of buying and selling ivory across state lines. On November 17, 2018, Cooper offered to sell to an undercover USFWS Special Agent multiple ivory pieces for a total cost of $8,125. On November 26, 2018, Cooper sold two pieces of carved elephant ivory to the undercover agent and mailed the items from Virginia to New York. Upon forensic investigation, the items were confirmed to be genuine elephant ivory. Cooper is scheduled to be sentenced on August 31. As part of the plea, Cooper will forfeit approximately 136 pieces of raw and carved ivory. He faces a maximum penalty of 1 year in prison.

Sixty-eight-year-old Italian national, Paolo Brondi, was subsequently arrested.  He initially appeared in a Mombasa court on June 20th before Principle Magistrate Martin Rabera and pled guilty to all charges relating to the .6 kg ivory statue that was found in his luggage.  As there was no Italian interpreter in court, Magistrate Rabera adjourned the case to June 22nd and so ordering an interpreter to attend. He was not comfortable that Brondi had a full appreciation to the seriousness of the charges he was facing. On June 22nd, with an interpreter in court, Paulo Brondi pled not guilty to four charges; possession of wildlife trophy, manufacturing an item from a specified endangered trophy, importing a wildlife trophy into the country and bringing into a customs area prohibited goods, the last charge under the East Africa Community Customs Act. Magistrate Rabera has remanded Brondi until July 1st pending a probation report for the purposes of bond decision.

But Paolo Brondi, a Piedmontese who travels back and forth from Italy to Watamu, where he would plan to settle a few months a year, now faces a very heavy penalty for possession of an ivory figurine weighing about six hundred grams. Brondi, who is well known among the Italians stationed in Watamu and considered a decent person who has found like many in Kenya a place to relax and enjoy a prolonged vacation, was stopped a few days ago upon arrival at Mombasa's MOI International Airport with the valuable ivory necklace and, after being detained by local authorities, admitted that he was its owner and that he had brought it especially from Italy but that since it was a worked object (with a sculpture depicting himself, as reported by the TV channel K24 news site with an estimated value of 17 thousand euros) he did not think it was a crime. In fact, Kenya punishes the possession and trafficking of ivory, both with regard to elephant tusks or pieces of them, and with regard to worked and semi-processed items that are not properly reported and have certificates attesting to their age and provenance. Already in the past, there have been cases of seizures and fines for those who failed to report historical hunting trophies or other wildlife relics (including ivory), and the Kenya Wildlife Service had issued an ultimatum to all owners of objects or parts of land or sea animal species that it is illegal to capture and possess (except precisely for ancient objects duly reported in times of no suspicion). Now Brondi, who has already appeared a first time before Mombasa Judge Martin Rabera and pleaded guilty to the charge of possessing a trophy wildlife of endangered species, contrary to Section 92 (4) of the Wildlife Conservation and Management Act, will have to appear in court hearings in Mombasa to explain exactly how and where he got that ivory in the hope that Kenyan authorities will understand his good faith and his terrible naiveté that led him to ignore not only Kenyan but international laws.

They were caught while using Rwanda as a transit country to smuggle 45 kilogrammes of ivory from the Democratic Republic of Congo to Asian countries, according to RIB Spokesperson Thierry Murangira. The illicit merchandise was transported in a Toyota double cabin which had diplomatic number plates. The destination countries were not specified. The suspects include two Rwandans – one of them working with a regional body which earned him diplomatic status – one Burundian and a Congolese national. Desire Murokozi, who is the head of finance at the regional power development firm SINELAC, and Derrick Gisa, are the two Rwandans while Cyriaque Kaburaburyo, is the Burundian national, and Nicodem Bagabo, Congolese. The quartet however does not agree on the account of the events. According to one version, a one Gideon Imanishimwe who is the alleged ‘boss’ and remains at large, got in contact with Murokozi and interested him in the deal. The deal was to transport ivory from DR Congo and transit through Rwanda to the Asian market. According to Kaburaburyo and Bagabo, the 45 kgs were given as a sample to Imanishimwe who had earlier requested for a larger consignment. They were intercepted on their way to Kigali from DR Congo via the Rusizi border. The Burundian national claims to have put in touch the ivory owner based in DR Congo with Murokozi, but claims he was not part of the negotiations and only accompanied the latter because he was his boss. On the other hand, Bagabo said he travelled to Kigali to get the payment from Imanishimwe, which he would then take back to the ivory owner in DR Congo. However, Murokozi denies knowing anything about it, saying he only offered the trio a lift in his car from Rusizi to Kigali. ""I had no idea what was in their bags, and I was not involved in their business,"" he explained. According to Murangira, the four were arrested last week on Friday and they were still looking for their collaborators, including Imanishimwe. ""Any individual who hunts sells, injures, or kills a protected animal species or its products commits an offense,"" Murangira declared, citing Rwandan Law on Environment N°48/2018 in its article 58. ""It is not only a crime in Rwanda, but it is also a violation of the international treaty on the protection of endangered species,"" he continued, adding that Rwanda should not be used a transit of illicit merchandise. Murangira said that the four are detained at Kicukiro RIB station pending conclusion of investigations, after which they will be handed over to prosecution. Upon conviction, they risk a sentence of not less than five years and not more than seven years in prison, as well as a fine of between Rwf5 million and 7 million. https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/190644/News/four-arrested-for-trafficking-ivory-from-dr-congo",1

Strict enforcement of this law is therefore necessary to stem the extinction of elephants in the country and in the region. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the elephant population, particularly the African forest elephant, is in steep decline due to poaching. Ofir Drori, founding director of the Eco Activists for Governance and Law Enforcement (EAGLE Network) said the poaching situation in the sub-region is serious, especially in northern Congo and south-eastern Cameroon. This iconic animal faces a serious threat, due to its ivory, and is on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. Elephants play a very important role in our ecosystem and many environmental scientists say urgent action is needed, as IUCN Director General Dr Bruno Oberle said: “We urgently need to put an end to poaching and ensure that we conserve adequate habitat, sufficient for forest and savannah elephants. Several African countries have shown the way in recent years, proving that we can reverse the decline of elephants, and we must work together so that their example can be followed."" https://www.alwihdainfo.com/Cameroun-deux-trafiquants-arretes-avec-pres-de-60-kg-d-ivoire-a-Yaounde_a117118.html",1

They concealed the tusks in a suitcase and transported it on a motorcycle to a residence where they were expected to carry out the transaction. Soon after they arrived, the arresting team moved in and apprehended them. The contraband was concealed in Briqueterie, a notorious neighbourhood in Yaounde known for wildlife trafficking and other dangerous criminal activities. The traffickers belong to a trafficking ring operating in major ivory trafficking hotspots in the country and especially in a town close to the border with Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. The traffickers are linked to Abdoul Salami, arrested in 2021 with 2 tons of pangolin scales and leopard skins. The ring operates in Congo, Gabon, Nigeria and beyond. Close relatives attempted to free the traffickers by applying pressure on wildlife officials but the attempts were combated. https://www.eagle-enforcement.org/data/files/eagle-briefing-september-2022-public.pdf",1

Daily Express,https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1807092/Africa-elephants-poachers-wildlife-crime,2023-08-29,"A wildlife crime charity has smashed a “mafia-type” smuggling ring taking more than £95,000-worth of ivory out of Africa. A six-day operation by Conservation Justice, part of the EAGLE Network, and local agency partners in Gabon was described as a “significant turning point in the relentless fight against the illegal ivory trade”. Operatives for the charity, as well the Provincial Directorate of Water and Forestry and the Anti-Poaching Directorate of Gabon’s Moyen-Ogooué province, discovered the ivory hidden in secret compartments in a truck. The tusks are believed to have come from forest elephants and represent at least nine slaughtered animals. In total, 19 elephant tusks and four pieces of ivory weighing a total of 120kg were recovered. In China a kilogram of ivory is worth around 1,000 US dollars. The shipment also held 18 rounds of 458 caliber hunting ammunition which could be used to shoot and kill elephants. More than £1,000 in cash was also discovered. Approximately seven people were arrested in the operation including several “key players”, according to Luc Mathot, founding director of the NGO Conservation Justice. He said: “This type of operation is vital and should be repeated to dismantle the few large ivory trafficking networks that have managed to survive in Gabon, where the political will to protect the environment remains strong. “The forest elephant population is estimated at 95,000 and appears to be stable, making it their last big refuge. But the pressure remains, particularly from Cameroon.” From Cameroon the ivory is exported out of Africa to countries like China, as well as Europe and the US. According to Conservation Justice, the smuggling networks provide funds, ammunition and facilitates to transport the ivory from elephants killed by organised poachers, posing a serious threat to the survival of elephants and national security. Vehicles fitted with secret compartments are used to conceal the ivory and evade controls. More than a dozen people could be involved, with ivory drop-off points spread across various provinces of Gabon. The charity said “organised mafia-type networks” are prepared to do anything to enrich themselves. Ofir Drori, founder of the EAGLE network, which is active in a dozen countries including Cameroon and Gabon said: “The illegal wildlife trade is routed in corruption. This is a good example for that of a very criminal network driving elephants to extinction. ""It has already been caught once and rewarded with a ridiculous sentence only to continue their illegal activities undisturbed. One of the main leaders of the network was sentenced in Cameroon to a ridiculously low prison term despite being arrested with more than 600kg of ivory in 2020.

In early August, police in the province of Moyen-Ogooué arrested a Gabonese man of Cameroonian origin, along with his wife. A search of their vehicle revealed a cache of 19 tusks and four pieces of ivory, weighing a total of 120kg. For context, 19 tusks mean at least nine elephants had been killed. The search also led to the confiscation of several rifle cartridges used for shooting big game, nearly 1 million CFA francs (about 1,500 euros) in cash, illicit substances and an expired residence permit belonging to a well-known Cameroonian ivory trafficker, according to Stephan Ekore Eko, an anti-poaching specialist at Gabon's Ministry of Water and Forests. Using fresh information from the suspect, the investigators were able to track down more traffickers. A total of ten people were arrested in separate locations, and nine of them were charged with involvement in “international ivory trafficking”, according to Jean Donald Ulrich Mbadinga, a legal expert with Conservation Justice. He said it took ten days for the operation to unravel the “vast network of international ivory traffickers in Gabon”. “The ivory is taken from Gabon, is trafficked across the border to Cameroon, and from Cameroon to Nigeria and from Nigeria to the Asian market,” he said in a video sent to RFI. He explained that the network functioned like a pyramid: “At the top, there is a leader who resides in Cameroon, and this leader works with collaborators who can be divided into two categories: the poachers’ canvassers and the transporters.” Canvassers comb the whole of Gabon in search of villagers who can kill elephants, Mbadinga explained. Then when the ivory is available, transporters to go with the canvassers to collect it. The ivory is then transported to Cameroon, he said. “This type of operation is vital and should be repeated to dismantle the few large ivory trafficking networks that have managed to survive in Gabon, where the political will to protect the environment remains strong,” says Luc Mathot, founding director of  Conservation Justice. https://www.rfi.fr/en/africa/20230910-gabon-takes-down-international-ivory-trafficking-network",1

Punch Nigeria,https://punchng.com/customs-arrest-three-for-trafficking-elephant-tusks-worth-16000/,2024-02-09,"The Nigeria Customs Service on Friday said it had arrested three men for alleged illegal export of elephant tusks to Asia. The men were arrested at different locations in Lagos between January 25, 2024, and February 4 and 6, 2024, for allegedly facilitating the sale and export of five pieces of elephant tusk, weighing 25.35kg, and worth about $16,000 equivalent (N23,520,000). It was gathered that the arrest involved the Customs Special Wildlife Office, and the Customs Police Unit during an intelligence-led, joint enforcement operation with the Wildlife Justice Commission. Nigeria is in a push to protect its dwindling elephant population from rampant wildlife traffickers, and Illegal wildlife export contravenes the Endangered Species Act and the Nigeria Customs Service Act. Over the past three decades, the country’s elephant population has declined drastically from an estimated 1,500 to less than 400 due to poaching for ivory, habitat loss, and human-elephant conflict, according to conservationists. The officer in charge of Nigeria Customs Service Special Wildlife Office, Assistant Comptroller Abim Isafiade said the Service is leaving no stone unturned in its commitment to end Illegal wildlife trade. He said that on January 9, 2024, Nigeria destroyed 2.5 tonnes of seized elephant tusks valued at over N9.9bn ($11.2 million). “The Service is determined to dismantle the wildlife criminal networks operating within the country. “Illegal wildlife trade or trafficking of wildlife is a criminal offence punishable under law, and so Nigeria Customs Service will continue to support global efforts to fight Wildlife crime. “The suspects will be charged to court as soon as investigations are concluded,” Isafiade said. Experts say tens of thousands of elephants are killed worldwide each year for their tusks. That is despite a decades-long ban on the international trade of ivory. According to conservationists, Nigeria has become a hub for the illegal trade in animal parts from Africa. The biggest markets are said to be in Asia. https://punchng.com/customs-arrest-three-for-trafficking-elephant-tusks-worth-16000/",1
