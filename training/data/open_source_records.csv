In this operation mounted on September,10, 2021, one suspect Opio John David was arrested while the other Lt. Kakooza Bright Saad fled the scene of arrest. The illegal dealers had been trailed for over a week following credible leads from the UWA intelligence team that the two were intending to trade in some ivory pieces around Kampala. This operation kicked off following a long trail of intelligence coordination that suspects were in possession of ivory. The suspects were trailed for days by the UWA intelligence team to numerous Kampala suburbs. When positive identification of the suspects travelling in a Subaru car UBF 540S was finally confirmed, the intelligence team pursued the suspects to apprehend them. While racing to avoid arrest, the suspects driving the said Subaru car veered off the road knocking several cars and eventually grounding to a halt. “It is then that one suspect was arrested and the other fled the scene of the crime. Upon search of the car, seven pieces of ivory, army uniform, boots, phones belonging to one of the suspects, and Civil Aviation Authority’s security pass were recovered from the car,” UWA stated. The search is on to apprehend the other suspect who fled the scene. The suspects will be aligned before the courts of law and charged accordingly. This, according to UWA’s executive director, Sam Mwandha, sends a signal to all wildlife offenders that once caught they will be arrested and prosecuted. “The news of more arrests should echo in the ears of whoever is thinking of involving themselves in wildlife crimes to desist from such actions.

In the town of Lambaréné in western Gabon, three alleged wildlife traffickers have just fallen into the net of the judicial police. They were arrested in possession of approximately 81 kg of ivory. The loot was stolen from the ivory storage warehouse of the Lambaréné court of first instance. The recent operation against wildlife trafficking in the town of Lambaréné in western Gabon was successful. On 23 June 2022, a trio of alleged wildlife traffickers were arrested. All Gabonese nationals, the suspects were preparing to sell six whole elephant tusks as well as seventeen pieces of ivory tips and a panther skin carefully stored in suitcases and travel bags, when they were apprehended. The total weight of the catch was around 81 kg of ivory. Curiously, the marked ivory pieces, according to the defendants, came from the seals of the Lambaréné court of first instance. With the help of two accomplices working for this court, the alleged traffickers are said to have robbed the storage warehouse of the seized ivory pieces. The success of this operation was due to the joint intervention of the judicial police, the General Directorate of Wildlife and Protected Areas (DGFAP) and the Provincial Directorate of Water and Forests, supported by Conservation Justice, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) working for the application of the wildlife law. The alleged traffickers will have to answer for the possession and attempted sale of trophies of fully protected species. They were taken into custody at the Lambaréné judicial police station pending their presentation to the Special Prosecutor’s Office in Libreville. The latter has been dealing with this type of case for the past three years, with the result that 80-90% of the ivory traffickers arrested have been sentenced to prison terms of up to 10 years for ivory trafficking. Cases of wildlife trafficking involving law enforcement officers are becoming a concern in Gabon. “These organised networks in the various types of lucrative trafficking must be firmly combated, as they can dramatically erode the rule of law by diverting certain servants of the law from their prerogatives and duties,” explains Conservation Justice in a note. The vulnerability of the storage sites for seized ivory and hunting weapons encourages ivory trafficking in Gabon. And in 2020, tips were stolen from the Lambaréné Court and tips from the Libreville Court were even seized in neighbouring Cameroon. In 2015, nearly 300 kg of ivory disappeared from the court in Oyem in the north of the country. The 2012 audit report on government ivory stocks states that ivory tusks registered at the Lambaréné court had disappeared. A year earlier in 2011, another report by the National Parks Agency revealed the disappearance of 17 ivory tusks from the Makokou court stockpile in the north-east of the country.

Police in north-central Vietnam have arrested nine people for allegedly trapping 215 pangolins to traffic them. The animals, weighing a total 600 kilograms, were found at three locations in Ha Tinh Province’s Huong Son District by officers from the Ministry of Public Security and the local police department. They also found an item weighing a kilogram that they suspect is ivory. The five women and four men in custody are all locals and the police are investigating further. Pangolin trafficking is not rare in Vietnam, where it is legally protected and categorized as endangered. The shy, tiny creature, which resembles a scaly anteater, is the world's most heavily trafficked mammal despite bans. Pangolins are hunted in Vietnam and its neighborhood for their meat and the alleged medicinal properties of their scales. Of the 10 countries and territories with the largest number of trafficking incidents, seven were in Asia -- China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand, Laos, and Indonesia – a study by wildlife trade monitoring group Traffic and Australia’s University of Adelaide in December 2017 had found.

Vietnamese police have detained nine people in an animal trafficking bust related to the endangered pangolin, police reported late Thursday. About 2 pm (0800 GMT) Thursday police checked the house of Tran Trung Thanh in Cong Thuong village, Kim Son 1 Commune of Ha Tinh province. Officers allegedly found 215 pangolins weighing a total of 603 kilograms, the Ministry of Public Security said in an online statement. Native to Asia and Africa, the pangolin is a scaly mammal that eats insects. Its scales are used in traditional medicine in parts of Asia, although the trade is illegal internationally.

Authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo have seized 2 metric tons of ivory in the city of Lubumbashi, a hub for ivory trafficking. The May 14 seizure is one of the largest in recent years, according to Adams Cassinga, who heads Conserv Congo, an NGO that fights wildlife trafficking and which took part in the operation. The seized ivory is estimated to be worth $6 million. Authorities arrested three people, believed to be members of one of the major wildlife trafficking rings in the region. The network is linked to the smuggling of 20 metric tons of ivory in the past five years alone. The latest seizure represents more than 150 elephants killed for their tusks, Cassinga said. The tusks originated from countries in Southern Africa, which has seen a surge in ivory trafficking in the 2000s, fueled by demand from Asia, particularly China. Ivory found in a stash house in Lubumbashi, the Democratic Republic of Congo. Image courtesy of Adams Cassinga/Conserv Congo. At the height of the crisis, 30,000 elephants were being killed every year, an average of 80 a day. African elephant populations have shrunk by 80% in the past 100 years, according to an analysis by WWF. The African savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana) is considered endangered on the IUCN Red List, while the forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) is critically endangered, only a step away from being extinct in the wild. Poaching has declined in recent years, a 2021 report by Geneva-based nonprofit Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC) found. One of the factors cited for the dip is the weakening of criminal networks because of raids and arrests. “The reduced poaching seems to be the result of the dismembering through arrests and prosecutions of a large number of transnational organized criminal networks involved in ivory poaching and trafficking in East and southern Africa between 2014 and 2020,” the GI-TOC report said. The Lubumbashi raid was led by the DRC’s top conservation authority, known by its French acronym, the ICCN. It included members of the national police force, court officials and the NGO Conserv Congo. The team recovered the ivory from a stash house in Lubumbashi in the southern DRC. Traffickers brought the poached parts into the DRC from Zambia, which lies on the country’s southern border. Lubumbashi has emerged as a major hub from where poached wildlife parts are funneled out of Africa. The items originate primarily in Southern African countries like South Africa, Zimbabwe and Zambia. “We are sure it will bring a great deal of deterrence in a place where previously wildlife laws were neglected and not applied,” Cassinga said in a tweet. Weak enforcement of laws, armed conflict and corruption have allowed international gangs to operate with impunity in western and Central Africa. The DRC, which shares borders with nine countries, serves as an important transit point for the movement of trafficked parts. The Central African nation, which hosts the largest swath of Congo Basin rainforest, is also a source country for illegal wildlife goods. Yet, from 2000 to 2014, when elephant poaching was rampant, the DRC recovered only around 8 metric tons of ivory in seizures. Then, between 2015 and 2019, authorities there confiscated 20 metric tons, according to data collected by the Environmental Investigation Agency, an NGO based in the U.K. “We are making strong efforts to take down all the illegal trade networks. With time, we have bigger impacts on the illegal networks,” Olivier Mushiete, head of the ICCN, said in a phone interview with Mongabay. The Lubumbashi raid follows a series of raids in the DRC capital, Kinshasa, last year. Mushiete told Reuters at that time that they expect to recover more than 60 metric tons in future seizures. The current operation was a result of three years of investigation. “The relationship between the government and the civil society is improving. You can see that it is yielding results,” Cassinga said. He added that support from partners like Zambia-based Wildlife Crime Prevention and international donors like the Rhino Recovery Fund is helping them combat wildlife trafficking. The skull of an elephant recently killed by poachers who ripped out its tusks in Province Orientale, DRC. Ivory poaching is one of the most lucrative illicit trades, valued at around $23 billion a year, according to Bloomberg. CITES, the global convention on the wildlife trade, banned the international commercial trade in ivory in 1989. However, some countries continue to allow domestic trade and international trade, subject to varying degrees of regulation. In the past decade, efforts to curb ivory demand have gathered pace, with the U.S. imposing a near-complete ban on elephant ivory trade in 2016 and China banning the domestic trade in 2017. The EU tightened its rules on the ivory trade in 2021. Narrower exemptions limit the legal ivory trade, which conservationists say often serves as a cover for unlawful transactions. The three suspected traffickers from the Lubumbashi raid are due to appear in court this week. Even if seizures and arrests increase, the impact on poaching could be limited by countries’ failure to prosecute alleged traffickers. Coordinating cross-border investigations and amassing the necessary evidence is tricky. Wildlife crimes are often not prioritized by law enforcement agencies or judicial authorities. The arrest of two Vietnamese nationals during the seizure of 3.3 metric tons of ivory from Uganda’s capital, Kampala, in 2019 did not result in convictions; both suspects skipped bail. Raids also tend to net intermediaries but rarely lead to the capture of those who organize, fund and benefit the most from this illegal trade. “As far as dismantling the network, that is unlikely. It may be slowed down,” said Chris Morris, who works with the Kenya-based organization Saving Elephants through Education and Justice (SEEJ). “These cartels are a business. They are prepared for losses from seizures and arrests.”

An international police operation coordinated by Interpol targeting the movement of illicit firearms in Central and West Africa has led to some 120 arrests and the seizure of firearms, gold, drugs, fake medication, wildlife products and cash. Operation Trigger VIII, which ran from June 13 to June 19, involved some 520 law enforcement officials targeting 35 hotspots across eight African countries: Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania and Niger. More than 20,000 checks were carried out against Interpol’s global databases, resulting in the recovery of 480 firearms and 42 arrests tied to firearms offences. In addition, 14 organized crime networks were identified and dismantled. Authorities seized some 6,000 firearm parts, components, ammunition and explosives, and EUR 110,000 in cash. Reinforced border controls and surveillance once again demonstrated that organized crime groups are benefiting from a convergence of crimes and using the same routes for a number of illicit activities. An additional 78 arrests were made in connection with trafficking in illicit goods, with more than 45 tonnes seized, including more than 3 of fake medication, 1.5 tonnes of drugs (cannabis, amphetamines and opioids) and more than 10,000 litres of contraband petrol. Some 40 tonnes of fins of endangered shark species were recovered in Guinea, while authorities in the Central African Republic dismantled a network suspected of supplying poachers with firearms and ammunition. The Democratic Republic of Congo reported the seizure of 141 elephant tusks. With illicit gold mining suspected of financing terrorism and armed militant groups in the Sahel region, authorities also launched more than 85 active investigations into the links between firearms trafficking, transnational organized crime and terrorism financing. More than 26 kg of illicitly mined gold and 170 kg of explosives were seized during the operation. “In a Sahel region plagued by insecurity, I welcome the undertaking of such an operation, which contributes to the strengthening of international police cooperation, the only guarantee of success in the fight against terrorism and other forms of crime,” said Roger Ouedraogo, Director General of Burkina Faso’s National Police. Interpol Secretary General Jürgen Stock added: “Operations such as Trigger VIII underscore how firearms trafficking represents a grave transnational threat, facilitating the activities of organized crime networks and terrorist groups.” “They also highlight the connections between different types of criminality and the continued need for cooperation between countries and across regions,” added Secretary General Stock.

AUTHORITIES IN SOUTHEASTERN DR Congo have seized one and a half tonnes of elephant ivory, legal and environmental officials said, in one of the largest hauls in Africa in years. Officers discovered the smuggled tusks aboard trucks in the city of Lubumbashi on Saturday, according to a legal official who declined to be named due involvement in an ongoing investigation into the affair. Police arrested five people but two fled after questioning, the official said. He added that the haul amounted to 1.5 tonnes. Both the origin and intended final destination of the ivory remain unclear. Sabin Mande, a lawyer for a coalition of environmental groups, told AFP that he had seen 18 bags of seized ivory in the state prosecutor’s office in Lubumbashi yesterday. The contraband represents 80 to 100 slaughtered elephants, he said. The seizure marks one of the largest in Africa in years. In 2013, Kenyan officials made several seizures including one of four tonnes. Togolese authorities likewise seized four tonnes of ivory over the course of one week in 2014. In 2019, Vietnamese officials discovered over nine tonnes of elephant ivory in a shipment carrying timber from the Republic of Congo, also known as Congo-Brazzaville, in the largest recent haul worldwide.

A shipment of one and a half tons of smuggled ivory was seized last weekend and three suspected traffickers arrested in Lubumbashi, in the southeast of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a judicial source said Thursday. The origin and destination of the ivory are not known, an investigation is underway. “On Saturday, our services seized some 1,500 kg of ivory,” said this judicial source, who did not wish to be identified. “Five people who were transporting the ivory in long trucks were arrested but two fled after questioning,” the source added. According to the source, “the three Congolese arrested say they were simple transporters, who do not know the origin or final destination of the packages and claim that those who fled are the owners. Mr. Sabin Mande, a lawyer for the “Natural Resources Network”, a platform of Congolese environmental NGOs, said he had seen on Wednesday at the public prosecutor’s office in Lubumbashi, the capital of Haut-Katanga, “18 bags full of ivory weighing a total of more than 1,500 kg”. According to him, this represents the slaughter of “80 to 100 elephants”. “This is criminal,” he commented. This is one of the largest ivory seizures made on the African continent. Seizures of two to four tons have been made in Kenya and Togo in the last ten years. The largest recent seizure in the world was made in Vietnam, with nine tons discovered in March 2019 on a ship from Congo.

Six men, all truck drivers from Hosur, Tamil Nadu, were arrested while transporting ivory across the state border on Thursday. The police officials of Hebbagodi Police Station arrested the men and seized the pair of elephant tusks. According to the sources, all the six accused are in the age group of 30-35 years. Following a tip off about the tusks being brought in from Hosur, Tamil Nadu to Bengaluru, the team swung into action and arrested the accused as they were crossing the state border. “The total weight of the ivory seized is around 14 kilograms. The police officials got the information that some individuals were transporting ivory from Hosur in Tamil Nadu to Bengaluru and arrested them while they were passing through the Hebbagodi Police Station limit. All the accused are truck drivers from Hosur. Initially, two members of the gang were arrested while transporting the ivory on a two-wheeler during the night. Upon interrogation, they gave information about the rest of the four members of the gang and later they were arrested too,” police said. The gang also said they were on their way to meet someone in the city and discuss the sales process. The Hebbagodi Police Station has informed the Tamil Nadu Forest Department about the incident. The whereabouts of the animal carcass is still unknown.

In a major operation, officials of the Karnataka Police Department and Tamil Nadu Forest Departments came together to arrest an inter-state gang in connection with a recent ivory smuggling case. In what can only be described as a well-coordinated interdepartmental approach, both the accused were arrested by the officials for their involvement in transporting ivory across the state border on February 16. The officials from Tamil Nadu Forest Department tied up the loose end for Hebbaguddi police officials by nabbing both the absconding men and handing them over to the officials for further interrogation. Earlier, the Hebbaguddi police officials had arrested six men while they were transporting a pair of tusks weighing 14 kilograms. Officials say that all six arrested were only the middlemen. “The main accused were at large. We have now arrested two men – Pavan Raj and Basavaraj,” informed Karthikeyani K, wildlife warden, Hosur forest division, Tamil Nadu Forest Department. Karthikeyani said, “We were tipped off on their whereabouts through local intelligence. Once we had their addresses, we arrested one of the accused from his home, whereas the second accused was nabbed later from the neighborhood,” said. “So far, the accused have maintained that the tusks were not obtained from a live animal. As per the information they are divulging, they found the tusks in a rocky area around their village in Hosur. However, further interrogation is on,” said a police official. Wildlife experts say that this is a clear case of poaching and there should be comprehensive inquiry into the issue. Sharath Babu, a wildlife enthusiast, said: “It is not a case of tusks collection after the animal has shed it naturally. The animal, in all probability, was shot and the tusks were harvested. Tusks that are shed naturally look different.” He further stated, “One of the tusks is larger than the other. When an elephant is shot by an untrained hunter, the animal either falls on its left or its right. So, while the tusk facing the sky can be easily harvested, the one on the ground cannot be taken out completely because of the weight of the animal.”

According to our source, François Moukambi Moubeyi, a 48-year-old Gabonese, was caught in possession of two ivory spikes cut into four pieces that he was about to sell in one of the rooms of a motel in the city. Questioned as soon as he was arrested, the surveyor by training tried from the outset to exonerate himself by claiming not to be the owner of the ivory found in his possession. It was only after several hours of interrogation that he cited a certain Jean-Marie Pilima, a 70-year-old Gabonese, as the person who had given him the prohibited product. The latter will be apprehended in turn in another district of the city. However, unlike his colleague Moukambi, Pilima showed good faith by driving without the slightest hesitation, the agents to the home of Mohamed Backo (Gabonese 50 years old) whom he had previously designated as the true owner of the two points. The three individuals were taken and placed in police custody in the premises of the Directorate General of Research (DGR), pending transfer to Libreville to be presented before the Public Prosecutor at the specialized formation of the Court of First Instance of Libreville. Under the provisions of the new Criminal Code in force, they face up to 10 years' imprisonment. This operation owes its success to the synergy of the team that led it. It was composed of agents of the provincial branch of the General Directorate of Research of Ogooué-Ivindo and an agent of the Provincial Directorate of Water and Forests, supported by the NGO Conservation Justice.

The Malawi police in Nkhotakota are keeping in custody a 34-year-old man for allegedly entering into protected Nkhotakota Game Reserve and killing an Elephant. This happened after Parks and Wildlife Assistants (PWA) on Tuesday December 10, 2019 arrested him inside the game reserve. According to Nkhotakota Police Public Relations Officer, Sub Inspector Williams Kaponda, the suspect was identified as Samuel Kaliati. Kaponda said he was found with a pair of Ivory weighing about 31 kilograms which according to game officials was removed from an Elephant worthy about MK19Million which he killed. “In August this year, the suspect entered Nkhotakota game reserve and searched for an Elephant trail along Lisitu River. “He put bread contaminated with acid poison deliberately for the Elephant to eat. Three days later, he killed one Elephant a few meters from where he put the poisoned bread.” he said. Kaponda said following a tip from community members that Kaliati was keeping Ivory illegally, on October 9, the Parks and Wildlife Assistants tricked him as potential buyers. “The officers instigated for a meeting to buy the commodity. However, the deal flawed as the suspect, while negotiating for the price got suspicious and ran away,” he added. The police spokesperson said Ivory was immediately confiscated and the suspect was only arrested two-months afterwards (on December 10, 2019) upon his return in the village. The suspect will soon appear before the court of law to answer charges of entering into protected area and killing protected species without permission contrary to section 32 and 33 respectively of National Parks and Game Reserve Act of 2017. The suspect hails from Mugando village, senior chief Kanyenda in Nkhotakota district.

The arrest of a Malayali father-daughter duo in Kolkata in connection with illegal trade of ivory sculptures is expected to shed more light into the Malayattoor poaching case, the biggest-ever poaching case reported in the country. According to Malayattoor Division Forest Office, around 416 kg of ivory artefacts were seized from the accused persons in connection with the poaching case. The Forest Department charge sheeted 41 persons and the trial in the case is yet to begin. Sudheesh Chandra Babu, an accused in the case who was absconding, was arrested along with his daughter Amritha by sleuths attached to the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) Kolkata unit from Kona Expressway near Santragachi Railway Station on Monday [11/03/2019].  Elephant tusks weighing 3.144 kgs, worth `30.93 lakh were seized from the duo. Further, the DRI team raided residential premises on Rajdhanga Road based on the information provided by the duo and seized ivory idols and jewellery worth `72.35 lakh. As per the information provided by the duo, the idols were made from elephant tusks procured from Kerala. Train tickets seized from Sudheesh Chandra Babu corroborated the information that he travelled from Kottayam to Santragachi with the contraband goods. Wildlife Crime Control Bureau sources said the family has been on the radar of forest sleuths for at least four years. The family’s involvement in poaching was revealed in 2015 after the confession of a former forest watcher who moonlighted as a guide for poachers led to the arrest of 50 persons and seizure of over 400kg of ivory. The tusks seized on Monday were en route to Nepal, a senior DRI official said. “Sudheesh and his daughter would have sold the tusks to a buyer in Calcutta who would then send them to Nepal via Siliguri,” the official said. The father and daughter were produced in Bankshall court on Tuesday and remanded in judicial custody till March 19.

A woman and her father, who she had gone to pick up from Santragachhi station on his arrival from Kottayam, were arrested on the way to their home in Kasba on Monday and identified as ivory traders on the forest department’s radar for several years. Two pieces of elephant tusk weighing around 3kg were found in the Volkswagen Vento in which the father and daughter were headed home. A raid on their Kasba apartment yielded several intricately carved ivory statuettes. The combined worth of the hauls would be several crores, sources in the forest department said. Elephants are protected under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Killing the animal or keeping any ivory item can invite at least three years in jail and a fine of Rs 50,000. “Sudheesh Chandra Babu, 67, and his daughter Amitha SC Babu, 37, were in the Vento that was stopped at the intersection of Kona Expressway and Carry Road around 11.15am on Monday,” said an official of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), the intelligence wing of the customs department that made the arrests. Sudheesh’s wife, wanted in a 2015 elephant poaching case in Kerala, and their son are absconding, the official said. “She goes by the moniker Calcutta Thankachi (sister),” said an official of the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, which is assisting the DRI in the case. The family, originally from Thiruvananthapuram, shifted base to Calcutta after forest officials and police in Kerala launched a hunt for them.

Smuggled elephant tusks of around Rs 1 crore were recovered at the Khoribari forest area of Darjeeling in a joint operation by Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) and West Bengal police, police sources said here on Friday. Three persons have been arrested in this connection. The three arrested have been identified as Asit Oraon, Anil Oraon and Punilal Nagachia. While Asit and Anil are residents of the Fulbari area, Punilal belongs to Garidhura. Based on a tip-off that a group of wildlife smugglers were trying to smuggle an elephant calf in a mini-truck through the Khoribari forest area, a joint team of district police and SSB personnel launched a search operation. Finally, the vehicle was apprehended at the Ghoshpukur forest range in the Khoribari area. However, instead of the calf, smuggled elephant tusks were recovered from their possession. The estimated market value of the item seized will be to the tune of Rs 1 crore,"" a state police official said. The three persons arrested could not furnish any document or provide any information regarding the tusks. This made the sleuths believe that the items seized were meant for smuggling. The police are currently interrogating the three to track their other associates. According to police, this particular belt in north Bengal has become a hotbed of wildlife smuggling. Just six days ago, a Trinamool Congress leader in the adjacent Alipurduar district was arrested by sleuths of the state's forest department while attempting to smuggle a pangolin.

Vietnamese authorities have over the past week seized more than 600 kilograms of ivory smuggled from Africa, the government said on Monday. Trade in ivory is illegal in Vietnam but wildlife trafficking remains widespread. Other items often found smuggled into the country include pangolin scales, rhino horns and tiger carcasses. Customs authorities in the northern port city of Haiphong on Monday found nearly 130 kilograms of ivory hidden in a container of cow horns originated from Africa, the government said in a statement. This followed the finding of nearly 500 kilograms of African ivory on Thursday last week at Lach Huyen Port in the city, the government said. This has been the largest seizure of smuggled ivory in the country in more than four years. The authorities had in October 2018 seized more than eight tonnes of ivory and pangolin scales in one of the country's largest wildlife trafficking cases for years.

Two days after the carcass of a tusk-less elephant with its head sawed-off was detected in the core of Similipal Tiger Reserve, a person from Mayurbhanj was arrested by Keonjhar forest division with two ivories on Saturday. Keonjhar DFO Dhamdhere Dhanraj Hanumant said the tusks were recovered from 34-year-old Bilash Mankadia from Melana village of Ghatagaon range. The accused, however, belongs to Kendumundi village of Karanjia sub-division in Mayurbhanj. Acting on intelligence inputs, a team of forest officials and staff from the division carried out a decoy operation and apprehended the accused near a road in the Melana village and recovered the tusks from his possession on Saturday afternoon. Hanumant said the tusks weighed about 10.160 kg and the accused is being interrogated to get more details regarding its smuggling.It is yet to be established whether the tusks belong to the elephant poached in Pithabata range of Similipal (south) division or to the tusker poached in Athagarh. “The tusks looked somewhat fresh and we are trying to ascertain where the accused procured them from and if others are involved,” said another official from the division. Currently, an official in the rank of Conservator of Forest (CF) is investigating the poaching of the elephant in Similipal, while investigation into Athagarh case seems to have lost direction after death of an accused in custody of forest staff recently.

The Chama Subordinate Court has sentenced a poacher to seven years imprisonment for illegal possession of elephant ivory weighing 10 kilograms. Lovemore Nkhowani, 60, a former wildlife police officer who turned into a “notorious” elephant poacher nicknamed Mbanje, was charged with one count of Unlawful Possession of Prescribed Trophy contrary to the Zambia wildlife Act. Ministry of Tourism public relations officer Sakabilo Kalembwe stated that officers of the Department of National Parks and Wildlife arrested Nkhowani on 26th May 2020. The ivory is suspected to have been illegally harvested from an elephant poached in West Musalangu Game Management Area. In sentencing him, the court told the suspect that as someone who was once a wildlife police officer under the department, he should have known the importance of conserving wildlife. The court reminded Nkhowani that his duty was to protect wildlife and educate his community on the importance of conservation rather than to engage in poaching. The court also stated that it hoped the punishment handed to Nkhowani would deter other officers from committing similar offences,” Mr Kalembwe stated.  https://zambiareports.com/2020/06/17/ivory-lands-poacher-7-years-sentence/#:~:text=Ministry%20of%20Tourism%20public%20relations,West%20Musalangu%20Game%20Management%20Area

In Gabon, efforts to fight crime related to protected wildlife species have just resulted in new arrests. A joint team of agents from the Water and Forestry Administration and the Judicial Police in the province of Ogooué-Ivindo in northeastern Gabon has just dismantled an ivory trafficking circuit operating in the town of Makokou. A total of four individuals involved in the commercialization of ivory were arrested on April 5 and 6, 2023. The first was arrested with four ivory tips, two of which were whole and two cut into pieces. Overwhelmed by this arrest, he revealed the details of this case. He confirmed that he was the owner of part of the ivory found in his possession. The driver was also arrested at the same time. On April 6, the owner of the severed ivories and another intermediary were arrested in turn. Arrested with the technical assistance of Conservation Justice, all of these suspects are being prosecuted for possession, attempted commercialization, as well as complicity in possession and complicity in attempted commercialization of ivory tips. Articles 390 and 392 of the new Gabonese penal code provide for a prison sentence of up to 10 years and a fine equivalent to five times the market value of the ivory spikes found in their possession. It should be noted that a pair of ivory tips can easily be traded for 22,500 euros, according to estimates by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW).

Diego, 79, though retired, still carries a Red Passport and a business card indicating him as a Consultant Deputy Consul General, with his address being Consulate General of Italy, 2590 Webster Street, San Francisco CA 94115. Exhibits He was arrested on Tuesday [13/04/2021] by detectives stationed at the Bugolobi Police Station in Kampala, and later transferred to Jinja Road Police Station. This followed the arrest of his Wife the previous Monday [12/04/2021], a Ugandan, who was detained at the Bugolobi Police Station, together with the Local Council leader of Panda – Pier Village, in Nakawa, a Division within Kampala City. ‘’The Local Council Leader, Tomusange Joseph, was nabbed with 2.5Kgs of worked Ivory pieces, following a trap laid by officers from the Natural Resources Conservation Network (NRCN) working closely with some detectives from the Uganda Police Force who presented themselves as buyers of the costly Ivory pieces’’, revealed a source. Some of the Exhibits Upon probing, Tomusange led Police detectives and the Conservationists from NRCN to the home of the former Italian Consul, where a further house search was done, leading to the discovery of more 3.75Kgs of worked Ivory pieces. ‘’On Saturday [10/04/2021], an officer of the NCRN had received a call from a whistle blower who tipped him that there was someone in Luzira with some Kilogrammes of Ivory to sell. The Officer immediately informed Police about the development’’, added a source. The following Sunday [11/04/2021], the officers of the NRCN– Uganda, with Police, met their informer, who showed them the ivory from a hidden sack. ‘’On confirming that the items in the sack were genuine Ivory pieces, the detectives immediately introduced themselves to Tomusange and arrested him. They then demanded that he takes them to the source of the Ivory’’, revealed an official from NRCN. [MOR35046]. Tomusange led the detectives to the residence of the diplomat, where a stand-off ensued, between the detectives and the Diplomat’s caretakers, who denied access. In the ensuing struggle for access to carry out a search, the caretakers released a guard dog which bit and injured one of the detectives on the left arm, before it was eventually subdued. In his statement to Police at Bugolobi Police Station, Mr Diego Marino did not deny that he was the owner of the Ivory pieces. Nonetheless, he says he had bought them several years ago from a hawker who he hasn’t identified. “I don’t sell Ivory. I have been here for over 10 years. I bought these things from a hawker here in Kampala”, Diego told the detectives from Bugolobi Police station. In Uganda though, offences related to trafficking in Wildlife are Strict Liability offences, meaning that regardless of what the defendant’s intents or mental state was when committing the act, possession of those materials can constitute criminal liability. The Officer in Charge Investigations at the Bugolobi Police station, James Mutaire, says Mr Diego Marino will be charged with 2 counts against wildlife. “We prefer 2 charges against him. One is Unlawful Possession of Specimen of Protected Wildlife contrary to Section 36 (1), and Section 71(1)(B) of the Uganda Wildlife Act, and secondly, Unlawful Transfer of Specimen of Protected Species contrary to Section 36(1) and Section 71 (1)(B) of the Uganda Wildlife Act”, said Mutaire. Exhibits On Monday, Experts from the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) joined the team of the Natural Resource Conservation Network (NRCN) to help with identification and prosecution of the suspects. In her 6 – page technical report dated April 13, 2021, an UWA Sergeant Major Twinamatsiko Harriet noted that she had confirmed that the 5.5Kgs of specimens handed to her by the police were actually of protected wildlife. “Having closely examined the features of the specimens as above and relating them with the known features of an Elephant and Hippopotamus, it was 99.9% highly probable that the specimens were 56 cut worked elephant Ivory pieces and one worked hippopotamus incisor tooth.” She said that her findings meant that at least 3 endangered animal species could have been killed to extract the pieces she observed. “At least two elephants died to obtain the specimens as described above considering the fact that an elephant has a pair of tusks and there were two complete worked tusks and several chopped ones. At least a hippopotamus died to obtain the one piece of the hippopotamus incisor tooth because the hippopotamus incisor belongs to the hippopotamus.

TRAFFIC; 2020-10-26
Cameroonian Customs officials last week seized 118 ivory tusks weighing approximately 626 kg, carefully hidden in a truck of merchandise at Ambam, in the Southern region of Cameroon. It is the largest seizure made in the area, where the three countries of Cameroon, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea meet. One suspect was caught at the scene and is reported to be a Cameroonian arriving from Gabon and has connections to an international wildlife trafficking network according to Cameroonian officials involved in the investigation. The size of the seizure is above the 500 kg threshold considered under Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) guidelines to be indicative of organised criminal activity and thus warrants full follow up investigations. “TRAFFIC congratulates Cameroonian Customs for this important seizure, and in line with CITES guidelines, we urge the authorities to carry out thorough forensic examination of the shipment and liaise with enforcement colleagues in any other countries implicated in the trafficking to try and bring the perpetrators to justice,” said Denis Mahonghol, TRAFFIC’s Director for Central Africa.

A suspected wildlife trafficker shall appear at the Ambam Court of First Instance on November 19, 2020 in connection with the trafficking of 626kgs of ivory. The charges were brought against him following his arrest in Ambam on October 21, 2020 with 118 tusks by customs. Mohamadou Ibrahim was arrested during a control mission at the border town of Ambam. The 47-year-old suspect was found in possession of 626kgsof ivory concealed in a hidden compartment built inside his truck. He was transporting the elephant tusks to Yaoundé for an illegal transaction when he was intercepted by customs. He was later handed over by customs to the Ntem-Valley Divisional Delegation of Forestry and Wildlife to continue with the prosecution process according to the procedure related to the prosecuting of wildlife law offenders. The case opened on October 26, 2020 and was postponed by the presiding judge to November 19, 2020 to enable both parties to prepare for the trial which will begin in earnest with arguments and presentation of facts. Further investigations revealed that some of the ivory was coming from elephant tusks seized by the Gabonese authorities and which were being kept in the government stockpile. This shows the extent and magnitude of the traffic in ivory on an international scale. According to sources with close proximity to the investigations who requested for anonymity, he is part of a ring network of wildlife traffickers, he transports ivory from Gabon to Cameroon and to Nigeria.

Amid celebration of the World Elephant Day, Odisha police busted an interstate wildlife racket allegedly involved in elephant killings in the state with arrest of key accused in Khordha district. The accused person has been identified as Razak Khan, a resident of Anantapalli village under Bolagarh Block in Khordha district. He was arrested from Parimula area under Begunia police limits on Thursday night, a day before the World Elephant Day. He is accused of killing over a dozen of elephants in Odisha and other states including Assam and Chhattisgarh. A joint team of STF, Khordha Special Squad, Khordha Police, Athagarh and Khordha Forest Division and Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF) nabbed the prime accused after four days of manhunt operation. The police also seized a huge cache of tusks from Parimula area where he was caught as well as his residence, sources said. According to reports, Razak was frequently changing his locations to give a slip to police. Sources said that he was hiding at several places in Begunia, Bolagarh, Banki, Tangi, Tikatal and Deuli in past four days. During interrogation, he admitted to have killed 16 elephants in Odisha. Reportedly, he was involved behind killing of elephants not only in Odisha, but also in other states such as Assam and Chhattisgarh. Following his arrest, he was handed over to Athagarh Forest Division to get more inputs about his crime. Based on data following interrogation, search operation is on to nab his 14 associates allegedly involved in elephant poaching. Expressing concern over rising number elephant poaching in the state, Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had recently raised the issue following death of a wounded tusker allegedly shot by poachers in Athagarh forest in the month of June this year. Taking cognizance of the killing of a young tusker, the Centre sought a report from the state government regarding action taken against poachers to ensure protection of wildlife heritage. Union Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister Bhupender Yadav pointed out that the elephant has been given the highest protection under Wild Life Protection Act. So far, Odisha has registered 13 cases of unnatural deaths of elephants in forests in the past 2 months making it the biggest casualty of the pachyderms in a short span in more than a decade.

After a thorough inspection of the box, the customs officer found a total of 4 milky white bracelets and bracelets, weighing about 310 grams, in a yellow bag. The objects had a crossed texture and belonged to the ""Shi's structure"" peculiar to ivory products, which travelers reported having been purchased from Nigeria on request. At present, the above-mentioned items have been detained and handed over to the relevant authorities for further processing.

The on-site verification results of the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology representative show that four animal horns are rhino horns; 37 circular blocks are made from ivory. According to the verification results of the Criminal Technology Division - Hanoi City Police, four rhino horns weigh more than 11.8 kg and 37 circular blocks made from ivory weigh 4.7 kg.

According to the declaration, on March 29, Mr N.B.D. carried out exit procedures from Vietnam to Angola. Until April 21, the suspect was on a flight from Angola to Doha (Qatar) and entered Vietnam. In Angola, Mr N.B.D. was paid V.N.D. 50 million by a man named Chung to transport two packages containing rhino horn and ivory to Vietnam.

When Mr N.B.D. transited at Doha Airport, the local law enforcement forces requested him to open a pack of baggage, detected four pieces of rhino horn wrapped with foil, and seized the above package.

On April 24, the competent authority at Doha allowed Mr N.B.Đ to return to Vietnam with one luggage package.

Mr N.B.D admitted that Mr Chung hired him to transport the packages to Vietnam; when he returned to Vietnam, someone would contact him to receive the packages, but no one had contacted him. Notably, Mr N.B.D. said he did not know Mr Chung. However, Mr Chung actively contacted and hired him to transport rhino horns and ivory to Vietnam, and this was the first time Chung hired him to transport these goods.

The Customs authority handover all profile and infringing goods to the Hanoi Police for investigation and handling.  https://english.haiquanonline.com.vn/over-16kg-of-rhino-horn-and-ivory-were-seized-by-noi-bai-customs-26142.html

Customs officers at Noi Bai International Airport have recently halted a haul of 11.8 kilograms of rhino horns and 4.7 kilograms of ivory elephant tusks smuggled into Vietnam. Rhino horns and elephant tusks have been found in luggage carried by a Vietnamese travelling from Doha to Hanoi. The package was owned by a Vietnamese man travelling on a flight from Doha (Qatar) to Vietnam on April 24, according to the police.  The man confessed that he had been hired by a man named Chung to transport two parcels of rhino horns and elephant tusks from Angola to Doha before bringing them to Vietnam for VND50 million. A further investigation into the case is currently underway. Vietnam is considered a hotspot for the illegal trade of wildlife products, including elephant ivory, rhino horns, tiger parts, and pangolins. These products are often considered a status symbol and are used for decorations and medicine, despite the lack of scientific proof of their medicinal properties. Vietnamese laws prohibit the hunting, killing, trade, or transportation of wild animals, although the high returns continue to lure many people into trafficking networks.

The Ahmedabad police on Wednesday arrested a man allegedly involved in smuggling and selling valuable animal parts at an international level.

During questioning, it was revealed that the accused, Prakash Chunilal Jain, had connections to the notorious Sandalwood thief, Veerappan.

He lived in the Salem area of Tamil Nadu from 1992 to 2006, used to visit Veerappan’s village Koltur from time-to-time and was also aware of the name of Veerappan’s wife.

He was also involved in obtaining large quantities of ivory through Veerappan’s gang members.

This information prompted the Ahmedabad Crime Branch team to collaborate with the Tamil Nadu Police and the Tamil Nadu Forest Department, leading to the registration of a case against the accused for the illegal sale of animal remains.

Acting on the instructions of the Joint Commissioner of Police and Deputy Commissioner of Police, under the guidance of the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Crime Branch, A.D. Parmar, the team of officers from the City Crime Branch successfully apprehended Prakash from Bodakdev, Ahmedabad.

The accused, wanted under various sections of the Wild Animals (Protection) Act, 1972, including Sections 2, 39(b), 44, 49(b), 50, and 51, was handed over to officials from the Tamil Nadu Forest Department’s Trichy range.

The crime registered was initially reported in the Tiruchirappalli range of Trichy, Tamil Nadu, where Prakash was found illegally selling the remains of various animals, including one tiger skin, two ivory, two deer horns and one fox tail.

This arrest is not the first encounter the accused has had with the law.

Previously, the Ahmedabad Crime Branch apprehended Prakash one-and-a-half months ago for the possession of elephant tusks worth Rs 35 lakh.

A case was registered under Section 379, 411 of the IPC and Section 39, 43(1), 43(2) of the Wild Animals (Protection) Act, 1972. Legal action was taken accordingly.

The continuous surveillance and investigation by the Crime Branch team culminated in the arrest of the accused, who has now been handed over to the Tamil Nadu Forest Department for further legal proceedings.

The owner of a Manhattan-based antiques store, along with his corporation, was charged with multiple felonies in connection with illegal ivory sales in New York County Criminal Court Wednesday, according to the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC).

Alexander Sakhai and Alexander's Antiques Inc., of 1050 Second Ave., were each charged with two counts of Illegal Commercialization of Fish, Shellfish, Crustaceans and Wildlife, a class E felony, and two counts Illegal Commercialization of Fish, Shellfish, Crustaceans and Wildlife, a class D felony.

DEC Environmental Conservation Police Officers (ECOs), working undercover on a tip, purchased an illegal ivory item from the store in July earlier this year. The item was brought to the American Museum of Natural History for morphological analysis, and experts there determined that the piece was carved from authentic elephant ivory.

A search warrant executed on July 21 by ECOs from DEC's Bureau of Environmental Crimes Investigation (BECI) unit revealed that the store was selling approximately 130 illegal ivory items in excess of $25,000. As part of the search warrant, the items were confiscated.

""Our ECOs are dedicated to cracking down on the illegal market for ivory and bringing an end to the senseless slaughtering of the world's elephants,"" said DEC Commissioner Seggos. ""This sends a clear message that we will not allow this trade to continue in New York. I commend the work of New York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance and his staff for their swift actions in prosecuting this immoral criminal activity.""

As part of the plea agreement entered today, Alexander's Antiques Inc. agreed to donate $60,000 to the Wildlife Conservation Society to help with its efforts to end the illegal poaching of elephants in Africa. Alexander's Antiques Inc. will also forfeit more than 100 ivory articles to New York State.

Sakhai also plead guilty to the violation of Illegal Commercialization of Wildlife, and the corporation plead guilty to the E felony of illegal Commercialization of Elephant Ivory.

MANHATTAN (CN) - The owner of an antique shop in New York City’s affluent Sutton Place enclave pleaded guilty Thursday to felonies related to his sale of illegal elephant ivory.

Alexander Sakhai’s plea follows a July 21 raid of his Second Avenue shop Alexander's Antiques in which authorities confiscated 130 illegal ivory items worth at least $25,000.

One of several raids conducted by the state in recent years, New York is striving to crack down on a trade that pulls in between $7 billion and $23 billion per year.

America ranks alongside China as the primary destinations for the ivory black market, and New York recently dropped from first to third place as a U.S. destination for ivory products.

In addition to ramping up prosecutions, the state has made several public spectacles in recent years of destroying the seized ivory. At one such display in August, authorities used a conveyor belt to feed $8.5 million worth of artifacts, vases, trinkets and tusks into an industrial rock crusher that ground the tchotchkes to dust.

Authorities say Sakhai’s shop was raided after an undercover officer with the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation received a tip and purchased an item made from illegal ivory in July.

Experts at the American Museum of Natural History, where the item was brought for morphological analysis, confirmed that the piece was carved from authentic elephant ivory.

""Our ECOs are dedicated to cracking down on the illegal market for ivory and bringing an end to the senseless slaughtering of the world's elephants,"" Basil Seggos, commissioner of the state conservation department, said in a statement. ""This sends a clear message that we will not allow this trade to continue in New York. I commend the work of New York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance and his staff for their swift actions in prosecuting this immoral criminal activity.”

Sakhai and his business were each charged with two counts of Illegal Commercialization of Fish, Shellfish, Crustaceans and Wildlife, a class E felony, and two counts Illegal Commercialization of Fish, Shellfish, Crustaceans and Wildlife, a class D felony.

While Sakhai pleaded guilty to the violation of Illegal Commercialization of Wildlife, his business pleaded guilty to the E felony of illegal Commercialization of Elephant Ivory.

Chennai, Sep 3 (IANS): Police and forest officials are on the lookout for culprits after the recovery of a 1.5 metre, 15 kg elephant tusk from a tribal settlement in Tamil Nadu, officials said on Friday. Officials did not reveal the name of the tribal hamlet from where the tusk was seized on Thursday [02/09/2021]. Chief Conservator of Forests and Chief Wildlife Warden Shekar Kumar Niraj told IANS that they ""cannot reveal the name of the tribal village from where the tusk was recovered. This would derail the ongoing investigation"". The investigation commenced after information was received of the carcass of an elephant, with its left tusk chopped, being found at the reserve forest area in Udumpalpet forest range. The forest officials said that there were no external injuries on the body of the elephant and that it seemed to have died a week ago. The forest officials also said that the arrest would be made in a couple of days and that the department has zeroed in on the culprits. An official said that the investigation is conducted in a scientific manner as DNA fingerprinting is being done, and phone calls made from the area are also being examined. The Sathyamangalam forest bordering Karnataka has been the area of operation for notorious poacher, Veerappan, who was later killed by a Special Task Force.

A team of forest officials of Anamalai Tiger Reserve (ATR), on Thursday, recovered the stolen tusk from a village about 6 km away from the site of the elephant death, that is, Kattupatti tribal settlement in Sadayamparai reserve forest area in Udumalpet forest range. On August 29 evening, frontline workers of the forest department found a carcass of a jumbo with its left tusk missing near Kattupatti tribal settlement in Sadayamparai reserve forest area in Udumalpet forest range. It was stated that the tusk was chopped off from the elephant carcass. The cause of death of the jumbo seemed mysterious. The pachyderm would have died a week ago. There were no external injuries found. According to forest officials, efforts are being taken to collect different evidence and collate to know about the cause of death of the animal. A team was formed to investigate the poaching case. Shekar Kumar Niraj, principal chief conservator of forest and chief wildlife warden told TOI, “It is not proper to reveal the name of the village, from where the tusk was recovered, as it would damage the ongoing investigation. It is the first time in Tamil Nadu that a poaching case has been zeroed in within four days of its occurrence”. He added, “As of now, we are close to arrest the culprits. It will be done sooner without leaving any loopholes for the offenders”. It was an outstanding investigation done by the team of ATR officials headed by Ganeshan, deputy director, ATR. The tusk is huge and about 1.5 metre long weighing about 15 kgs, according to Niraj. “The investigation is being conducted completely scientifically with various DNA fingerprinting done and CDR analysis of the calls made around the time and the area”, said the official. Full scale efforts are on to get the offenders under arrest, he added.

The Special Task Force (STF) of the Crime Branch on Friday [12/02/2021] arrested three miscreants from Jajpur district for wildlife trafficking and seized three elephant tusks from them. On a tip-off, the sleuths raided Kabatabandha Square near Brahmani bridge and apprehended Pitabas Barik and Ananda Mahakud of Keonjhar district along with Ambuja Pradhan of Jajpur. ""A case has been registered under Sections 379 and 411 of IPC and Section 51 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act. The seized elephant tusks will be sent to Wildlife Institute of India in Dehradun for further examination,"" said a senior STF officer. Barik, Mahakud and Pradhan were produced before JMFC court in Chandikhol later in the day. The accused will be brought on remand to verify where the elephants were killed and their links with other criminals. Sources said India does not have a huge market for elephant tusks. Suspecting that the tusks are being smuggled to other countries, STF officers are verifying possible links of the wildlife criminals nabbed in the last six days with local and international smuggling rackets. The sleuths had received an information about a planned wildlife deal after which they conducted a surprise raid near Keonjhar RTO on February 7 and apprehended Sheikh Hasmati Ali and Chandrakant Dhal of Karanjia along with Malaya Kumar Rout of Keonjhar district's Janghira. STF officers requested the court to grant them a seven-day police remand of two accused including Ali but they were allowed three-day remand for questioning the duo. Sources said the STF, DFOs of Mayurbhanj and Keonjhar are questioning Ali and another accused whose police remand started on Thursday. Ali allegedly has links with some wildlife criminals in Kolkata as well as in Nepal. Police suspect that the elephant was probably killed in Mayurbhanj or Keonjhar and efforts are being made to ascertain all the links of the illegal trade.

Agents of the National Police have intervened in Madrid 49 specimens of naturalized animals, some included within those that are of special protection in the International Agreement on Protected Species, as well as four elephant tusks, four hippopotamus tusks and two rhinoceros horns and 132 pieces of ivory. In the operation, which has been carried out in collaboration with the Madrid Municipal Police and the CITES Service (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), there is a man investigated for a continued crime of trafficking in species protected. All the specimens were exposed in two pavilions located in the farm where the address of the investigated is located, in Madrid. In the registry carried out in the same, the agents intervened 49 specimens of naturalized animals, such as bears, lynxes, leopards, wolves, crocodiles and primates. In addition, four elephant tusks, four hippopotamus tusks and two rhinoceros horns were seized, as well as 132 figures carved from elephant ivory. All the pieces were sealed and remained as a deposit in their place of exhibition, due to their high fragility. The investigation began in November 2019 when two agents from the Madrid Municipal Police Corps became aware of the existence of a collection of naturalized animals of various species --some of them apparently protected by the CITES Convention-- whose owner had the intention to give to a museum in a municipality of Badajoz. The Environmental Group of the National Police initiated the steps in order to prove the possible commission of a continued crime against flora and fauna or even one of smuggling. As a first measure, the researchers contacted the CITES administrative authority to determine if among the game pieces there could be any included among the species of special protection. This extreme was confirmed by said authority who determined that a high number of protected species was observed according to the different CITES Appendices and Regulation 338/97 of the European Union Commission. Likewise, it indicated that the investigated lacked many of the mandatory permits and certificates for its possession and importation into national territory. For a year, the person under investigation provided documentation with the aim of proving the lawful origin of the items seized, alleging that many copies were acquired prior to the date of entry into force of the CITES Convention in Spain. In the case of those specimens for which no valid documentation has been presented, on October 14 they were removed, subject to judicial authorization, and transferred to warehouses authorized by the National Museum of Natural Sciences and the administrative authority.

Another man has been arrested for illegal ivory dealing, being found trying to sell 21 pieces of ivory from his house in Gutu. Collin Tapfumaneyi Chizengeni (57) was arrested on Sunday, with a sack of ivory at his house in Munhende Location, while looking for buyers, national police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said yesterday. The latest arrest comes after police recently arrested five suspected poachers in Hwangeand recovered two rifles, including an AK47 assault rifle and over 60 rounds of ammunition, plus four elephant tusks, with an estimated weight of 13kg, and a fresh elephant tail and five jungle knives. Amos Mudenda (65), Patrick Mudenda (67), Liason Mudimba (49), Edwin Munsaka (32), and Lizwe Munenge (42) were charged with possession of raw unmarked ivory without a permit. Acting on a tip off, detectives pounced on the suspects who were searching for elephant tusk buyers in the Kamativi area, leading to their arrest. “The suspects were searched and four elephant tusks, with an estimated weight of 13kg, a fresh elephant tail, an AK47 with a magazine of 26 rounds and 29 AK47 loose rounds, a 375 rifle loaded with nine rounds, five 375 rifle loose rounds, four axes, and five jungle knives were recovered,” Asst Comm Nyathi said. In March, a suspected poacher was shot and killed at Malilangwe Conservancy Trust in Chiredzi during a gunfight with game scouts, while his two accomplices escaped. The three were spotted in the conservancy by the anti-poaching team, which confronted them, but they tried to escape by firing at the team, resulting in the exchange of gun fire as the game scouts fired back. Police recovered a CZ550 rifle loaded with one round in the chamber, two spent cartridges, seven spent cartridges of an MK3 rifle, a satchel bag containing a small iron axe and a flick knife. Police recently unearthed a black rhinoceros poaching syndicate that was moving around targeting the animals and de-horning them. The rhino is targeted for its horn, which sells for tens of thousands of US dollars in the underground, illegal wildlife markets.

A spike in seizures of elephant ivory from people emboldened enough to be trying to sell it openly in markets, from their houses, and even at a fuel station, has raised concerns among conservationists about a return of poaching. On May 1, 57-year-old Collin Tapfumaneyi Chizengeni was more audacious: arrested while trying to sell 21 pieces of ivory from his house in Gutu.

Police arrested two suspected poachers with 14 pieces of ivory Thursday which authorities said were taken from seven elephants in western Kenya. The National Police Service said a joint team of Busia county police officers and their counterparts from Kenya Wildlife Service arrested Mohamed Abbas, 60, his accomplice Paul Wafula Njoka, 70, and recovered the ivory. “To a few, these are just photos of pedestrian criminals arrested by police for a normal crime as they await their day in court,” police said while displaying photographs of the suspects. “To us and (the) majority of Kenyans who are passionate about the preservation of our national heritage, these are seven elephants of diverse ages killed for ivory, by humans.”  Police said a multi-agency team flagged the pair at Korinda junction in Busia following information that was shared by a civilian.  Authorities said the two suspects are in custody at Busia Police Station awaiting arraignment in court to answer the charges. They encouraged the public to protect wildlife and reject criminal acts against Kenya’s national heritage.

Four persons who were found to be selling parts of protected animal species and their skins have been arrested in Oyem, capital of Woleu-Ntem province in northern Gabon. They were arrested on Saturday, April 16, by the elements of the provincial service of judicial police in Oyem. The operation was carried out by judicial police assisted by elements of the Ministry of Water and Forests with the support of members of the environmental protection Non-governmental Organisation (NGO), Conservation Justice. All the four persons arrested are Gabonese and had in their possession four elephant tusks, an elephant tail, three skins and five panther teeth. This constitutes an offence contrary to Article 579 of the Gabonese penal code and Article 92 and 275 of the forestry code. It is also against Article 3 of the biodiversity and ecosystems preservation principle adopted by Law Number 0002/2014 on the sustainable development of the Republic of Gabon. The four traffickers were arrested in the middle of a sales transaction. One of them, who was only identified as A.N.G. was the owner of the two skins and five panther teeth. When his house was searched, 20 ammunition were found and further investigations led to the arrest of the other members of the network of illicit traffickers. Another member of the network identified as N.N.C. is a retiree who shot the elephant and cut off the tail and removed the tusks. A search conducted in his house in Nkout village found ammunition. The accused took the security team to the scene where the elephant was shot and the skeleton of the animal was found there.  Another of the suspects, who is a teacher and identified as A.J.B. was the owner of two elephant tusks which he said he found in the forest. A search conducted in his house found no further evidence. The four risk up to 10 years imprisonment, according to the Gabonese penal code. A senior official in the country’s Ministry of Water and Forestry told HumAngle that the protection of wildlife species and the forest constitute aspects of the sustainable tourism perspective of Gabon which is a “green power” on the international scene.

The pair of tusks measured 52 cm each in length, 15 cm circumference and weighed 1.89 kg (0.97 and 0.92 kg, respectively). Preliminary inquiry revealed that the small tusks belonged to a sub-adult elephant and that it could have been retrieved from the carcass at least a decade ago. The tusks reached the arrested persons after being passed on to various persons over the years. The tusks will be sent to the Advanced Institute of Wildlife Conservation (AIWC), Chennai for analysis. District forest officer (DFO) for Kodaikanal forest division, PK Philip, said that the operation was conducted based on a tip-off received by the principal chief wildlife warden. “Posing as prospective buyers, our team began the operation in the early hours of Saturday and nabbed them on Sunday morning,” he told TOI. It was decided that the sellers would show the tusks in their possession to the prospective buyers near a Tasmac outlet at Devadhanapatti on the Periyakulam to Batlagundu road in the early hours of Sunday for the buyers to check if the tusks were original or fake ones before they could decide on buying it. One of the accused Chinnaraj (29) brought the two tusks in a travel bag while the nine others were with him when the forest department team surrounded and nabbed them. While nine of them were arrested, search is on for R Suresh of Devadhanapatti in Theni who managed to escape on a two-wheeler. The arrested persons were identified as A Prakash (29), R Balamurugan (35), A Packiyarasu (30), K Muthaiah (57) and M Sarathkumar (30) all from Periyakulam in Theni district, A Vijayakumar (60) of Unjampatti in Theni district, C Chinnaraj (29), V Sivakumar (42) and A Abdulla (34) all from Usilampatti in Madurai district.

Isaac Mugwandia Macharia was arrested on Thursday morning in a joint operation by DCI special service unit team and Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) officers, who were acting on intelligence. The team said they recovered a G3 rifle magazine, five bullets, bow and arrows and one ivory from his house. The team also recovered assorted Sim cards, laptops, cell phones and storage devices. A process data quickly machine that police suspect could be used in fraud was also recovered from the house. Macharia was expected before Kamiti law courts to face cybercrime charges and a wildlife trafficking offence. Police spokesman Bruno Shioso said the arrest is a major breakthrough in cracking organized crime in the city. “We are looking for more suspects,” he said. He said the suspect is part of a five-member gang being sought after by the police. The five individuals include Ian James and a Congolese national Luodom Serge. James was arrested in December 2021 while in possession of narcotics and wildlife trophies. Poaching in the region is on the rise as armed criminal gangs kill elephants for tusks and rhinos for horns, which are usually shipped to Asia. As part of efforts to stop the crime, Kenya has started using high-tech surveillance equipment, including drones to track poaching gangs and keep tabs on elephants and rhinos. Parliament has also passed strict anti-poaching laws, and the government has beefed up security at parks to stop poaching, which threatens the vital tourism industry.  Kenya has special squads pursuing poachers. Regionally, Kenya has also emerged as a major transit route for ivory destined for Asian markets from eastern and central Africa. The illegal ivory trade is mostly fuelled by demand in Asia and the Middle East, where elephant tusks and rhinoceros horns are used to make ornaments and traditional medicines.

The undercover detectives disguised as customers arrested the suspect and handed him over to police headquarters in Kwale town for further investigations. Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) Community warden officer Omar Muichande has confirmed the incident.  The officers had posed as buyers after tracking the suspect for a long time before nabbing him on Sunday evening.  Kuri wanted to sell the tusks at Sh 100,000 each but they have a higher street value than that according to Muichande.  The KWS warden said the lone suspect is believed to have gotten the elephant tusks after poaching activities inside the Kuranze ranches. Police report reveals that tusks might have originated from Kuranze ranches within Kinango where three elephants are believed to have been killed.

The Herald; 2022-04-07
A ZIMBABWE Parks ranger at Sinamatela Camp in Hwange National Park and a police officer stationed at the Police Support Unit barracks at Chikurubi in Harare were arrested along with another man after they were allegedly caught selling elephant tusks in Greendale. Simibio Kakomo and Shepherd Musiniwa were taken to the Harare Magistrates Court where they jointly appeared with Enerst Kabanda charged with unlawful possession of elephant tusks. They were not asked to plead to the charges when they appeared before magistrate Mrs Barbra Mateko, who remanded them in custody to April 20 and told them that only the High Court could grant them bail. Mr Thomas Chanakira for the State said on Monday at around 7:45am, detectives from CID Minerals, Fauna and Flora Unit Harare were told that the three were selling ivory at Total Service Station along Julius Nyerere Way. They then pretended to be potential buyers before laying a trap. The detectives met Kabanda who told them to go Kamfinsa shopping centre in Greendale where Kakomo and Musiniwa were waiting with the ivory. Kamfinsa is along Arturus Road on the way to Chikurubi. When the detectives and Kabanda arrived at Kamfinsa, Kabanda allegedly contacted Kakomo, who came in the company of Musiniwa to meet the potential buyers. They agreed to sell the ivory for US$50 a kilogramme. After reaching an agreement, Kakomo and Musiniwa went to a building and brought a greenish sleeping bag which contained the ivory. The detectives then recovered eight pieces of ivory weighing 28,35kg valued at US$4,819.50, equivalent to $703,574.

A Sinamatella Parks ranger was arrested in Harare along with a serving policeman and a retired policeman, trying to sell 30kg of ivory. The ranger claimed to have picked up the ivory while on patrol in the Sinamatella area. There is a high degree of suspicion here, which also relates to who he was with on patrol when he claims to have found the elephant carcasses, which were not reported as required, plus other rangers on the patrol with the suspect must have been complicit. Investigations continue.

PALERMO – Four tusks of raw, unworked ivory were seized by the forest police of the nature anti-crime center of Palermo in a hotel in Palermo. The tusks, together with other artifacts always obtained from elephant parts, were exhibited to the public in the premises of the structure intended to host private events and were one of the attractions, so much so that they were often immortalized by patrons and posted on social networks. The Carabinieri of the Cites Nucleus are in action. The specialized military of the Cites Nucleus carried out an administrative check to verify if the owners of the structure had certificates and authorizations to keep the tusks. To date, no documents have been provided. For this crime, the penalty is imprisonment from 6 months to 2 years and a fine from 15 thousand to 150 thousand euros. In fact, ivory is subject to the protections provided for by the Washington Convention which governs the international trade in species of wild fauna and flora threatened with extinction, whose commercial exploitation (but also only possession) without the appropriate certificates constitutes a hypothesis of crime. The discovery is of particular relevance both for the size of the tusks, each more than two meters high and about 20 kilos in weight, and for the fact that they are unprocessed tusks, whose discipline is even more restrictive than that relating to worked ivory.

All the accused persons were arraigned on four count charges bordering on collecting, loading, transporting and attempting to export N22.3 billion worth of pangolin scales and elephant tusks. The charges brought against them in court were read in Manike language, a Guinean dialect, by a translator. They all pleaded not guilty to all four-count charges. Trial Judge Justice Tijjani Rigim ordered that the accused remain in the custody of the Nigeria Customs Service until September 1 when a counter application for a bail application filed by the defence counsel is filed by NCS.

Briefing reporters after the arraignment, counsel to the Nigeria Customs Service Smart Akande said all necessary applications would be filed before the adjourned date. Barr Akanfe said the five accused persons were supposed to have been arraigned in court on August 18 but was stalled by the absence in a court of a translator. He said recalled that the Comptroller General of NCS, Col Hameed Ali (retd), had on August 4 said officials of the service arrested three persons with different kilograms of Pangolin scales and Elephant tusks worth N22.3 billion in Lagos. ‘While displaying the seizures to newsmen in Lagos, the CGC Col said the 17,137.44 kilograms of Pangolin scales (196 sacks), 870.44 kilograms of Elephant tusks and 4.60 kilograms of Pangolin claws were evacuated at a location on the eastern side of Ijeoma Street, Lekki, Lagos State after proper examination. ‘He also said extensive collaboration yielded credible intelligence that triggered swift and comprehensive actions by the Customs Intelligence Unit and Headquarters Strikeforce,’ Akande added.

Officials in Nigeria - a hub for illegal wildlife trafficking - have seized a record amount of pangolin scales and claws and elephant tusks as the government attempts to combat the trade, the head of customs said on Wednesday. The seizure, worth 22 billion naira ($54 million), included 17,137 kg of pangolin scales, 44 kg of elephant tusks and 60 kg in pangolin claws, Colonel Hameed Ibrahim Ali, comptroller-general of customs, said in a statement. Ali said authorities had arrested three foreign nationals and were pursuing a fourth, whom he described as the kingpin of the operation. ""The suspects arrested will soon have their date in court as NCS will leave no stone unturned to bring them to justice,"" Ali said. Nigeria has become a hub for gangs sending African pangolins to Asia, according to law enforcement officials and wildlife experts. They blame insecure borders, lax law enforcement, corruption and access to large ports. Ali said customs was working with British, U.S. and German officials as well as international organizations to step up counter-smuggling operations. That ""extensive collaboration"" led to the seizure from Lekki, near Nigeria's main ports in Lagos The pangolin, a shy, critically endangered animal, has become one of the most trafficked mammals on earth due to demand for its scales in traditional Chinese medicine.

Some three tons of African ivory sat in an unmarked crate in a Cambodian port for more than a year, until a tip from the U.S. embassy led authorities to break it open this week and discover the country's largest-ever haul of trafficked ivory. Port laborers who recently gathered outside the facility told a reporter that no one had ever showed up to claim the valuable cargo. ""There are 12 containers and one container consists of elephants tusks packed in sacks and some sacks loading rocks which look like marble,"" said a laborer who witnessed the seizure at the Phnom Penh Autonomous Port Container Terminal on Thursday last week. Emily Zeeberg, the U.S. Embassy spokesperson, said American officials provided information to the Cambodian Customs and Excise Department that ultimately led to the search of a sealed container and to the seizure of 1,026 cut and whole pieces of ivory weighing approximately 3,370 kilograms. ""The ivory originated from Mozambique. Cambodia is a transit hub; there is no information indicating that the ivory was intended to be sold here in Cambodia,"" she said in an email. ""The investigation is ongoing."" Ros Vanna, chairman and CEO of Kampuchea Shipping Agency and Brokers, also known as Kamsab, which grants customs clearance to foreign ships, said the port does not have rights to open the sealed containers immediately if the owner does not come. He said if goods are abandoned, a court must intervene. Sun Chhay, a director of the Customs and Excise Office at the port, told VOA Khmer that the owner of the containers apparently did not show up to claim the cargo because they feared the smuggling operation had been exposed. Chhay confirmed that the ivory was imported from Mozambique and shipped through Vietnam, where he said it was not checked because that country's customs authority does not have the rights to check transiting cargo.

There was panic and fear at J- Smart guest house in Nansana West zone B, when police on Saturday night stormed the place to arrest one of their own, PC Patrick Katushabe, who was allegedly selling illegally obtained ivory. Since the operation was conducted at a quarter to 8 pm, many people had already booked rooms to rest, but the police raid caused panic and fears as clients reportedly wondered what had happened. Police officers who conducted the operation and witnesses intimate that some people attempted to flee but they were calmed down by being assured that the operation was only targeting illegal wildlife species dealers. “Some people were only in towels and others remained with their partners, peeping through the windows,” a police source said. “We saw some trying to flee but they were told that the operation wasn’t about them. Although it did not take many minutes, it left clients in shock,” an informant said. URN understands that Constable Katushabe was arrested alongside Dan Ayesiga after Uganda Wildlife Authority – UWA learnt that the duo had traveled from Hoima district in search of prospective buyers in Kampala. It is reported that Katushabe and Ayesiga started making calls to buyers when they were still in Hoima and UWA investigators disguised as interested buyers started engaging them. The false buyers kept demanding for details of where they could meet for the deal to be swiftly done. It was then that the unsuspecting duo revealed the place where they had booked for the transaction to be accomplished. Armed with details of the booked accommodation, UWA tipped Nansana police station. a Detective Assistant Inspector of Police –D/AIP was assigned to spearhead the operation which led to the arrest of Constable Katushabe and his colleague Ayesiga red-handed with 14 pieces of ivory. Before heading out to effect the arrest, the D/AIP registered the case as SD 52/05/11/2022. Even at the time of raiding J-Smart guest house, the suspects were in communication with UWA officers who were promising that they had come with all the money needed for 14 tusks. “Reaching Nansana west, the suspects were in communication with the team of wildlife officers who were luring them with the cash offer. The Suspects later were arrested in one of the Nansana guest houses known as J-smart and the exhibits were recovered in the same guest house. The two Suspects are detained at Nansana police station booked under SD 73/05/11/2022 for being in possession of wildlife species,” the D/AIP Ggiach states in the report sent to Kampala Metropolitan Police headquarters. Patrick Onyango, the Kampala KMP spokesperson, said he was yet to get details of the operations and exhibits recovered. But sources have said that Nansana police will deliver the exhibits to CID headquarters in Kibuli by close of business on Sunday. “Constable Katushabe has told us that he is from the ICT department of Jinja police while Ayesiga has said he is a driver from Hoima district,” a police source said. “These two came driving in a Toyota Wish UBM 662K and the 14 ivory pieces were in the boot.” Constable Katushabe and Ayesiga will be arraigned in the utilities court at Buganda road where they will face charges of being in possession of wildlife species. The information so far collected indicate that the ivory was harvested from elephants killed in Buliisa district.

3 traffickers arrested with 6 elephant tusks weighing 24 kg. The three were arrested in two swift back-to-back operations in two different towns. One of the traffickers, who operates under the guise of an entrepreneur, was arrested as he attempted to sell the elephant tusks that were cut into 8 pieces. He is the middleman of the group. He travelled over 100 km with the tusks concealed inside a black knapsack. After his arrest, investigations continued and two others were arrested in another town. During a house search that followed, two 12-gauge guns and several rifle bullets were found. One of the traffickers is a repeat offender, arrested 5 years ago before Gabon changed the law to a more deterring imprisonment. This time he will feel the difference.

A specialized team to combat trafficking in protected species and illegal wildlife trade is destabilizing a group of wildlife traffickers operating in the town of Mouila. Indeed, following a recent operation in the city of Lastourville, two new interventions coordinated by a mixed team composed of agents of the Mouila branch of the Judicial Police and those of the Provincial Directorate of Water and Forests, supported by the NGO Conservation Justice have just neutralized an alleged wildlife trafficker and two of his alleged accomplices. Two days after a similar operation in Lastourville that resulted in the arrest of an alleged trafficker, his two accomplices and the escape of a third repeat accomplice, another mixed team formed in the province of Ngounié deployed to the city of Mouila and Lébamba to carry out a joint mission to combat wildlife trafficking. This mission will give rise to two interventions that will allow the successive arrest of an entrepreneur in Mouila and two of his accomplices in Lébamba. In Mouila, the entrepreneur, who would be the broker of the group, was first arrested when He was preparing to conclude a transaction for the sale of six (6) ivory points in total, including 4 cut into eight (8) pieces. The continuation of the investigations will lead the agents of the mixed team on the trail of the one who would be the owner of the ivory points. He was arrested in Lébamba with another member of the group a few hours later. Back in Mouila and at the time of the search at the camp of the third member of the group arrested in Lébamba, the officers will discover and seize a hunting equipment including two (2) 12-gauge weapons and several large-scale hunting ammunition (458 caliber). According to information gathered from a source close to the case, the owner of the ivories would be known to the judicial police services for having been arrested and convicted for the same facts in May 2017. The three members of the group were taken into custody at the judicial police station in Mouila pending their transfer to Libreville before being presented to the special prosecutor's office. The alleged traffickers will have to answer for the facts of possession and attempted marketing of ivory. They face up to ten years in prison in accordance with the provisions of Article 388 of the Penal Code. The cases of recidivism that have emerged in these two operations challenge the actors involved in the application of wildlife legislation on the treatment of criminal sanctions imposed on ivory traffickers who continue to act after a first conviction. Three years after the strengthening of the criminal policy instituting ivory trafficking as an act of environmental crime in Gabon, these cases should know the sad application of the provisions of Article 388 to guarantee the maintenance of biodiversity, a tourism potential on which Gabon relies in its strategy of plan to accelerate the transformation planned by the government.

A Ugandan court has sentenced an ivory trader to life in prison - the longest sentence for such crimes in the country's history. A new law was passed in 2019 that toughened sentences for poaching or trafficking in endangered species. Pascal Ochiba was arrested in January this year with two pieces of ivory, weighing nearly 10kg (22lb). The magistrate said Ochiba, as a repeat offender, deserved life in prison for the future protection of wildlife. In passing sentence, the chief magistrate of the country's special wildlife court, Gladys Kamasanyu, said ""offences of unlawful possession of protected species are rampant and there is need to curb them"", according to a statement from the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA). ""This is a landmark achievement in our war on illegal wildlife trade in Uganda. We must do our best in our times to protect our wildlife otherwise history will judge us harshly,"" UWA Executive Director Sam Mwandha said. In 2020, the hunter who killed a silverback gorilla known as Rafiki received an 11-year sentence. In September this year, two men were each sentenced to eight years in jail for killing six rare tree-climbing lions. There are just over 7,900 elephants left in the wild in Uganda - these include both forest and savannah elephants. Forest elephants are categorised as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and savannah elephants are listed as endangered. The country's elephant population has been growing since the 1990s. The mammals still however face threats from poaching and trafficking. Ochiba had been sent to prison once before - in 2017 - after he was arrested with four pieces of ivory and the skin of an Okapi. Okapi are rare, zebra-like forest animals endemic only to neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo.

Before HON. M.O. RABERA-PM  COURT 8
2022-09-20 (Hearing): Today’s testimony was from P.C. Ahmed Mukhtar of the National Police Service, who was one of the officers at the arrest.  In the course of his testimony, he contradicted previous evidence of KWS officers and the contents of his original written statement regarding the location of the recovered ivory and the number of suspects at the arrest. During the testimony, Mombasa magistrate Martin Rabera, on several occasions had to interject, ordering P.C. Mukhtar to refrain from reading from written notes. Prosecutor Anne Nyawira subsequently had to make an application requesting the court to rely on the witness’s earlier written statement as evidence in chief. The accused’s advocate opposed the application, stating that the reason for the contradictory evidence was that his client was never arrested in possession of ivory and had been framed. Magistrate Rabera will make a ruling on the prosecution’s application on September 27th [2022].

In recent years, Nigeria has evolved into a primary transit hub for trafficking in illicit wildlife products, including pangolin scales, ivory and other protected species from Eastern and Central Africa, arriving in the country through its porous borders, as indicated in the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime’s (UNODC) World Wildlife Crime Report 2020.Nigerian authorities have stepped up enforcement actions against illicit trafficking of wildlife and forestry products. The Nigerian minister of environment, Mohammed Abdullahi, said the country is up-scaling its moves in combating wildlife and forest crimes citing the launch of the National Strategy Plan on Combating Illegal Wildlife and Forest Crime in Nigeria. Several large-scale seizures of wildlife and forest products took place in 2021. On 2 February 2022, the Nigeria Customs Service reported yet another seizure of 14 sacks containing 839.40kgs of pangolin scales and 4 sacks containing 40 pieces of cut ivory weighing 145kgs.

The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has intercepted N3.1 billion worth of pangolin scales and elephant tusks from a Siena with registration number KRD 541 HH in the Lekki area of Lagos. The Comptroller General of Customs, Hameed Ali, made this known at a news conference on Wednesday in Lagos. Ali was represented by the outgoing National Public Relations Officer of the Service, Joseph Attah. He said that the seizure was carried out on Feb. 2 by men of the CGC Strike Force. “Upon credible intelligence, the CGC’s Strike Force stormed Lekki area of Lagos and intercepted one Toyota Sienna bus with registration number KRD 541 HH with chassis: STDZA23C955338572 suspected to be loaded with un-Customs goods. “Immediately, the vehicle with its content, including four occupants (all Nigerians) were taken to the station and detained. “Upon 100 joint physical examination, the following items were found: 15 sacks of Pangolin scales and four sacks of elephant tusks. “The total quantity of Elephant tusks intercepted is 145kg while the total quantity of Pangolin scales is 839.4kg with a total value of N3,155,667,500,” he said. Ali noted that the operation was conducted in collaboration with the Wildlife Justice Commission, targeting the illegal trade of wildlife from Africa to Asia. He said the seizure of pangolin scales, ivory and other assorted wildlife parts in Nigeria was the fourth within the last 13 months. “We wish to specifically commend the Wildlife Justice Commission for their continued commitment to this cause through the provision of credible and actionable intelligence. Nigeria Customs appreciates this working synergy and look forward to more,” he said.

Six tonnes of smuggled ivory tusks and pangolin scales have been discovered in a container at Tien Sa Port in the central city of Da Nang. Customs officials in collaboration with relevant forces on January 11 decided to inspect what had been declared as cashew nut imported from Nigeria based on suspicious signs about the goods, resulting in the finding. The smuggled goods, including 456 kg of ivory and 6.2 tonnes of pangolin scales, were on the list of goods banned from trading under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The case is under further investigation. In July last year, more than 3.2 tonnes of rhino horns and bones of rare animals were found in containers at Da Nang Port. In March 2019, customs officials in Da Nang also seized 9.1 tonnes of smuggled ivory tusks.

More than 6.6 metric tons of suspected ivory and pangolin scales were seized by customs officers from a suspicious container recently shipped from Nigeria to Tien Sa Port in Da Nang, Vietnam. The customs declaration claimed its contents to be cashew nuts, but upon opening the container, officers found suspected endangered animal parts, including 456 kilograms of ivory and around 6.2 metric tons of pangolin scales, local customs officials reported on Thursday. The discovery was made during an inspection on Tuesday after customs officers at the port declared the container, which arrived at Tien Sa on January 5, as ‘suspicious.’ The Da Nang customs, in conjunction with other relevant agencies, have launched an investigation into the alleged smuggling. They are currently tracking the enterprises and individuals responsible for the container. Those involved in the case will be prosecuted, radio station Voice of Vietnam cited Tran Van Anh, deputy detector of the Da Nang Customs Department. Endangered wildlife products are strictly banned from being traded in, imported to or exported from Vietnam as they are protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), to which the country has been party since 1994. Several cases of smuggling wildlife products have been detected at Tien Sa Port in recent years, all shipped from Africa. In October 2018, local customs officers found some six metric tons of pangolin scales and around two metric tons of tusks stashed among recycled plastics in a container also consigned from Nigeria. In March 2019, more than 9.1 metric tons of ivory was discovered in a shipment delivered from the Congo, with the tusks hidden among timber. In July 2021, a shipment declared as wood but containing 138 kilograms of rhino horn and around 3.1 metric tons of wildlife bones arrived at the port from South Africa.

MEP’s intelligence unit worked alongside officers from the Entasekera police station to apprehend the suspects and seize their motorbike and the four pieces of elephant tusk. MEP’s vast network of intelligence officers and informants increases the opportunity cost for poachers and middlemen who bring ivory into Kenya to distribute globally.

[25,751.2 USD as of 29/04/2021]. Mr Gideon Kebati, the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) senior warden at the park said they pursued the suspects after a tip off by members of public at Kathithine area in Tharaka North sub county where they were arrested. “Our officers have been working on this information and finally caught up with them in the area known to be a hotspot for poaching. The undercover officers arrested them while in possession of the tusks,” said Mr Kebati. The suspects, who Mr Kebati said were being processed and will be arraigned in court as soon as investigations are complete, are Nicholas Kibara from Kathithine and Julius cMusili Mutemi from Mpeketoni area in Igembe North, Meru County. The suspects told investigators that they transported the tusks from Lower Imenti forest last week after being instructed by a convict, Mr Josephat Muthengi who is serving a five year jail term. Mr Muthengi was jailed by a court in Marimanti, Tharaka-Nithi county early this year [2021] after being found guilty of dealing in ivory. “Before he was jailed he had buried the tusks in the forest. During one of the visits at the prison by the suspects, the convict gave them instructions on where to retrieve the ivory and even made arrangements with a boda boda operator who would ferry the tusks,” Mr Kebati said. It was during the transportation that a member of the public got suspicious of the load and informed the police, the officer added. Before being jailed, Mr Muthengi was believed to have coordinated poaching activities in the area. “The prisoner is the mastermind of the deal and the fact that he can coordinate such an activity means he still has a network. We are on top of things and we will ensure we get those behind the criminal network,” Mr Kebati said “We will also hold talks with the prison commander with a view to establish what other links he has,” he added.

Omondi added that the officers also arrested four suspects who were carrying a gunny bag whose contents were later found to be 10 pieces of elephant tusks with a street value of Sh2.8 million. “The suspects have been placed in police custody pending arraignment on Monday,” he said. He urged the local residents to desist from engaging in illegitimate trade, warning that they risked being arrested. “We also urge members of the public to volunteer information, which we will use in confidence in order to secure our County,” he said.

Four suspects were on Saturday arrested while trying to sell ten pieces of elephant tusks weighing 28 kilograms in Busia Town. The four were riding on a bodaboda when they were intercepted by police and Kenya Wildlife Service officials who had been tipped off. Upon searching two gunny bags they were ferrying with ten pieces of elephant tusks weighing 28 kilogrames with an estimated street value of Sh2.8 million were recovered, police said. The two men and two women said they were taking the same to a potential buyer when they were intercepted on July 29. The buyer happened to be an undercover detective who had been tipped off about the deal. Police say they are yet to know the source of the tusks. The suspects were Monday, July 31 expected in court as police investigate the source of the tusks. Elephant tusks fetch a fortune in the black market as a surge in demand for ivory in the East continues to fuel the illicit trade in elephant tusks, especially from Africa. Officials say despite a ban on the international trade in ivory, African elephants are still being poached in large numbers. As part of efforts to stop the menace, Kenya has started using high-tech surveillance equipment, including drones, to track poachers and keep tabs on elephants and rhinos. KWS and stakeholders have put in place mechanisms to eradicate all forms of wildlife crime, particularly poaching. hese mechanisms include enhanced community education, interagency collaboration, and intensive intelligence-led operations, among others. These efforts led to zero rhino poaching in Kenya in 2020-the first time in about two decades. At least 20,000 elephants are killed annually in Africa for their ivory. This translates to 55 elephants killed daily or one elephant killed every 26 minutes with a population of 35,000 elephants. On April 30, 2016, Kenya set ablaze 105 tonnes of elephant ivory and 1.35 tonnes of rhino horn. Former President Uhuru Kenyatta led world leaders and conservationists in burning the remains of 6,500 elephants and 450 rhinos killed for their tusks and horn. Parliament has also passed strict anti-poaching laws and the government has beefed up security at parks to stop poaching, which threatens the vital tourism industry. Regionally, Kenya has also emerged as a major transit route for ivory destined for Asian markets from eastern and central Africa. The illegal ivory trade is mostly fuelled by demand in Asia and the Middle East, where elephant tusks and rhino horns are used to make ornaments and traditional medicines.

On Tuesday, February 18 in Makokou, an old suspect was caught red-handed in the commune of Makokou by agents of the Directorate General of Research (DGR).
Following information from an anonymous source, about a possible ivory transaction in the town of Makokou (Ogooué-Ivindo province), a team made up of agents from the General Directorate of Research, and of Water and Forests agents, supported by the NGO Conservation Justice was immediately formed. Upon arriving at the scene, the team set up arrangements to apprehend the alleged trafficker. An hour later, the indicated individual appeared. His demeanor caught the attention of officers. They immediately launched the assault and arrested the suspect. This is Mohamed Sany, a Beninese naturalized Gabonese subject, born March 2, 1970 in Libreville. Equipped with a black travel bag, he was found on him after the search, two (2) ivory points cut into four (4) pieces. Led to the station, he confessed during questioning to being the owner of the two (2) ivory points intended for sale. As a result, for investigation purposes, the latter was kept in custody in the premises of the Directorate General of Research. However, it should be remembered that this alleged trafficker, well known to the law enforcement agencies of the city of Makokou, has been followed since 2015. He has always managed to sneak in. Last month, he had again managed to deceive the vigilance of investigators. He faces 10 years in prison for violating the provisions of article 579 of the penal code.

The Oyo District Court in the Cuvette handed down its verdict on August 6 in the case of a wildlife trafficker, arrested on June 21 in flagrante delicto of illegal possession, circulation and attempted marketing of two ivory tips, weighing in total 20 kg. This is Bonheur Mafimba, a soldier belonging to the Republican Guard stationed in Brazzaville was sentenced to two years in prison, fined 500,000 CFA francs and another 500,000 CFA francs in damages. The slaughter, possession and marketing of trophies of a fully protected animal species (elephant), are the offenses justifying this decision of the district court of this locality. Bonheur Mafimba of Congolese nationality had been arrested in Oyo, in the Cuvette, by the police. Informed, the departmental direction of the forest economy of the Cuvette and the PALF project welcomed this arrest and provided legal support in this case. The ivories in question had been purchased by this wildlife offender from a resident of a village near a protected area before being transported to Oyo. This wildlife trafficker was about to resell them in Oyo, if the security forces had not intervened. The Oyo District Court thus stands out by sending a strong message in the pronunciation of this exemplary and truly dissuasive sentence.

A forester said IRB constable Ganesh Chhetri was the alleged mastermind of the racket. “We suspect he used his work identity to conceal the crimes,” the forester added. According to sources in the forest department, the team was tipped off about an animal parts deal to be struck at a roadside eatery in Odlabari, under Malbazar subdivision of Jalpaiguri, some 40km from here. A team led by Sanjay Dutta, range officer of Sarugarah forest range of Baikunthapur, reached the spot. “Around 2am, we spotted the group in front of the eatery. As we challenged them, two fled but the remaining six were caught with a vehicle. We found an elephant task weighing around 1.19 kilos, in their possession,” Dutta said. He added that they could not produce any document to prove the legitimacy of the ivory. Those arrested were identified as Gandup Lepcha and Samson Lepcha of Sombarey, Dhan Bahadur Pradhan of east Sikkim, Rohit Tamang of Arithang, Dawa Sherpa of Namchi and Ganesh Chhetri of Upper Kolthang, and produced at the chief judicial magistrate’s court in Jalpaiguri and sent to judicial custody for 14 days, a source said. Foresters came to know that the seized tusk was extracted from a wild elephant poached in Assam. “The arrested persons are habitual poachers and have killed at least 15 wild animals that include elephants, rhinos and even the clouded leopard. They have managed to sell animal parts and made Rs 1.5 crores,” said a forester.

Bhawanipatna, Jun 13 (PTI) The putrefied carcass of a full grown female elephant was found in the periphery of Karlapat Wildlife Sanctuary in Odishas Kalahandi district, taking the jumbo death toll in this particular area to nine, officials said. The carcass was sighted in a revenue forest near Karlapat Wildlife Sanctuary by forest workers on Saturday [12/06/2021]. The stunted tusks of the elephant were found to have been removed. With this, nine elephant deaths have been reported during the last four and half months in and around the wildlife sanctuary, they said. The carcass of the female elephant, aged between 30 and 35 years, was recovered from Ranibahal revenue forest within the Silet Gram Panchayat in Thuamul Rampur block under DFO South division, the Divisional Forest Officer (DFO), Kalahandi South Division, T Ashok Kumar, said. Though the area is outside the Karlapat Wildlife Sanctuary area, it is located in its periphery. During the investigation, it was found that one Dana Majhi of Surumundi village was reportedly the main culprit behind the removal of the tusks. Kumar said the tusks were recovered by forest personnel from the house of Dana Majhi at Surumundi village. Though Majhi has escaped to the Muuchkund area of the Rayagada district, the forest department with the help of Rayagada forest staff is looking for him, Kumar said. The remaining elephants of the herd are being monitored by a joint team of Kalahandi South Division and Rayagada Division, he said. A post-mortem examination of the carcass was conducted by veterinary staff and samples of the internal organs were sent to the Centre for Wildlife Health in Cuttack and Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology in Bhubaneswar, for laboratory testing. Veterinary department sources said the death of the elephant is estimated to have taken place at least 20 days ago.

BHAWANIPATNA: The carcass of an adult elephant was found in a partially decomposed state from Ranibahal revenue forest on the outskirts of Karlapat wildlife sanctuary in Kalahandi's Thuamul Rampur block on Saturday. The tushes of the female elephant, aged around 35 years, were missing from the carcass. It is believed that the jumbo got separated from its herd and died around 20 days back. On being informed, forest officials rushed to the spot, which is near Kardapadar beat under Silet panchayat. During investigation, it was ascertained that one Dana Majhi of Surumundi village and his associates had removed the tushes from the carcass. Kalahandi divisional forest officer (DFO), South T Ashok Kumar said the tushes were recovered from Dana's house. Two persons were also arrested for their involvement in removing the tushes. They are Sani Majhi of Surumundi and Prashant Kaushalya of Mutukuni. However, prime accused Dana is on the run. The DFO informed that Dana has reportedly escaped to Rayagada district. The Rayagada forest officials have been informed and efforts are on to nab him, he added. Sources said it is yet to be ascertained if the elephant was killed by poachers or died of any other cause. A veterinary team conducted postmortem of the carcass and samples of its lungs, intestine and bone marrow were sent to Animal Disease Research Institute, Cuttack and Centre for Wildlife Health at OUAT, Bhubaneswar for testing. Kumar said the movement of the remaining elephants of the herd, which is roaming in and around the sanctuary, is being monitored with a joint team of Kalahandi and Rayagada forest personnel. This is the second elephant death reported from Karlapat wildlife sanctuary in the month. In the first week of June, the carcass of a six-month-old calf was found at Katingkuna within the sanctuary. As many as nine elephants have died in and around the sanctuary in the last five months. In February this year, carcasses of five female elephants and two calves were found inside the sanctuary. The deaths were attributed to haemorrhagic septicemia.

The police are coordinating with the Riau Natural Resource Conservation Agency (BBKSDA) to determine where the tusks came from.

Salomon Mpay 51, was arrested at a Kinshasa hotel on Jan. 30, following a two-year joint investigation between the Congolese Institute for the Conservation of Nature (ICCN) and Conserv Congo, a Kinshasa-based not-for-profit. Mpay, who goes by the pseudonym of “The King,” was caught with 35 kilograms (77 pounds) of cut-up ivory, which he intended to sell to an undercover agent posing as a client. He was also in possession of almost 2.5 metric tons of pangolin scales. However, delays in issuing a search warrant following his arrest meant accomplices had time to move the contraband before the authorities could return to seize the goods. Photos on his cellphone indicated a further ivory stockpile of 3 metric tons kept at an undisclosed location; investigators are actively looking for the items. Similar quantities of pangolin scales and ivory have sold for as much as $8 million and $6 million, respectively. On April 22 [2021], Gombe Magistrates Court in Kinshasa, the capital, sentenced Mpay to two years in prison. While Mpay’s arrest has been hailed by conservationists as a rare victory in the fight against the illegal wildlife trade in DRC, lawyers acting on behalf of ICCN, the state-run wildlife authority, and Conserv Congo have lodged an appeal, through the public prosecutor’s office, describing the sentence as unduly lenient for a transnational wildlife trafficker whose career spans three decades. “He is one of the few local traders that I know of who has got a passport full of stamps — mainly in Africa,” Conserv Congo founder Adams Cassinga told Mongabay. Mpay is linked to a number of traffickers across the continent, including in Zambia, Uganda, Burundi, South Sudan, Central African Republic, Angola, Republic of Congo, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. Documents in his possession at the time of his arrest attested to his dealings with people in Southeast Asia, where he is known to have sent multiple consignments of wildlife contraband. “He is a major link. A network is a chain of people, you can cut the link — his conviction won’t affect the trade, per se, but it will affect the organization,” Cassinga added. The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) is providing financial and legal assistance to support the appeal.

A team of forest officers raided an apartment in Tripunithura here and arrested five youths while they were trying to sell two elephant tusks on Tuesday. P A Jaleel, Range Forest Officer, flying squad, Perumbavoor, said the elephant tusks, weighing 1.046kg and 1.226kg, were seized from the five youths – Roshan Ramkumar, 29, of Tripunithura; Shebin Sasi, 28, of Eroor; Midhun T M, 26, of Irinjalakuda; Sanoj T A, 30, and Shemeer K R, 36, of Paravoor. The gang had been demanding Rs 1 crore for the tusks, which are said to be worth Rs 40 lakh in the international market. Posing as prospective buyers, a team led by Ernakulam Forest flying squad DFO Raju K Francis contacted the gang, which was staying at Jasmine Apartment on Irumpanam road.  This is the second elephant tusk seizure this month. On January 6, employees of Valara forest station under the Neriyamangalam range had arrested a man and seized two elephant tusks. The arrest came following a search which was launched after an elephant bone was found on the land owned by Abdul Salim of Kullamankuzhi. A male elephant had been electrocuted and Santhosh, 45, a worker, had cut its tusks and kept them in his house. The team led by range officer Arun K Nair and deputy ranger R Ajay had raided his house and recovered the tusks.

Four civilians, members of this network, were also arrested during an operation carried out by elements of the National Gendarmerie. The six alleged traffickers who make up the network were arrested successively on January 27, 28, 31 and February 2, 2021 in Pointe-Noire, the economic capital of the Republic of Congo. This series of arrests was carried out with the support of agents from the Departmental Directorate of Forest Economy of Pointe Noire and PALF (Support Project for the Application of the Law on Wildlife). This punch operation allowed the seizure of four (4) ivory tusks, weighing 101.3 kg, representing approximately four (4) slaughtered elephants, several objects worked in ivory namely 20 sticks, 15 pendants, 04 round bracelets, 02 chopsticks with balls. Initially, four individuals were arrested, including two on 27 January [2021] and the other two on 28 January 2021 with an ivory tusk. The investigations into this case led to the arrest of two other members of this network. The adjutant was arrested on January 31, 2021 with two (2) ivory tusks and the sergeant arrested with an ivory tusk on February 2, 2021. This soldier of the Congolese armed forces confessed to having used his service weapon to shoot down an elephant in the forest of the district of Banda in the Department of Niari. The other five are being prosecuted for the offenses of illegal possession, circulation and marketing of the seized ivory tusks. Note that the arrested gendarme is also a sculptor and sells products worked in ivory. These alleged wildlife offenders, all of Congolese nationality, have all admitted the facts with which they are accused. They are said to be familiar with the illegal trade in wildlife products in the town of Pointe Noire. The ivory seized is believed to come from the villages of Konongo in the Department of Kouilou and Ngokosso in the District of Banda, Department of Niari. The latter will answer for their acts before the Congolese justice and risk sentences of up to five years of imprisonment and 5 million FCFA in fines, each. The illegal trade in wildlife products is leading to the extinction of wildlife species around the world. This illegal trafficking is the third most profitable form of trade after drugs and weapons. Recall that the elephant enjoys absolute protection in the Republic of the Congo following the 1991 decree as well as an act of the Sovereign National Conference. The species is threatened with extinction in many places in Congo due to poaching for its spikes. Article 27 of the Congolese law on the protection of this wildlife species states: ""the importation; export; the detention and transit on national territory of fully protected species; as well as their trophies are strictly prohibited; except special dispensation from the water and forestry administration; for the needs of scientific research ”.

Gabon News; 2019-06-18
The operation begins on Saturday, June 15, 2019 at 12 noon. Samuel Adama, 28, is a Ghanaian national. The team of conservationists, made up of agents of the judicial police (PJ) branch of the province of Nyanga (south-east Gabon) and agents of the provincial directorate of the same service, supported by the NGO Conservation Justice, surprised him in a motel room, a place more used by traffickers. He had in his possession an ivory point of about 22kg, cut into three pieces. At the origin of this important operation, reliable information reached the agents evoking the detention and marketing in progress of an ivory point in a motel in the city of Tchibanga. In Nyanga province, not a month goes by without a case of wildlife trafficking. When questioned, the offender was not asked to denounce one of his accomplices, Yves Kevin Mihindou, a 31-year-old Gabonese. The latter will eventually be apprehended a few hours later, thanks to the tenacity of the police and members of the NGO Conservation Justice. He will admit that his dirty work was organized with two other accomplices. The two other accomplices wanted by the police were finally apprehended in turn on June 17 while they were in the village in the region of Dubinda-forest where the accomplices usually conduct their hunting party. They are Cédric Moundounga and Lewis Mouketou, two Gabonese aged 31 and 25 respectively. The four offenders are currently in police custody at the PJ premises pending further proceedings. Law enforcement officers remain vigilant as their struggle continues.

Diego, 79, though retired, still carries a Red Passport and a business card indicating him as a Consultant Deputy Consul General, with his address being Consulate General of Italy, 2590 Webster Street, San Francisco CA 94115. Exhibits He was arrested on Tuesday [13/04/2021] by detectives stationed at the Bugolobi Police Station in Kampala, and later transferred to Jinja Road Police Station. This followed the arrest of his Wife the previous Monday [12/04/2021], a Ugandan, who was detained at the Bugolobi Police Station, together with the Local Council leader of Panda – Pier Village, in Nakawa, a Division within Kampala City. ‘’The Local Council Leader, Tomusange Joseph, was nabbed with 2.5Kgs of worked Ivory pieces, following a trap laid by officers from the Natural Resources Conservation Network (NRCN) working closely with some detectives from the Uganda Police Force who presented themselves as buyers of the costly Ivory pieces’’, revealed a source. Some of the Exhibits Upon probing, Tomusange led Police detectives and the Conservationists from NRCN to the home of the former Italian Consul, where a further house search was done, leading to the discovery of more 3.75Kgs of worked Ivory pieces. ‘’On Saturday [10/04/2021], an officer of the NCRN had received a call from a whistle blower who tipped him that there was someone in Luzira with some Kilogrammes of Ivory to sell. The Officer immediately informed Police about the development’’, added a source. The following Sunday [11/04/2021], the officers of the NRCN– Uganda, with Police, met their informer, who showed them the ivory from a hidden sack. ‘’On confirming that the items in the sack were genuine Ivory pieces, the detectives immediately introduced themselves to Tomusange and arrested him. They then demanded that he takes them to the source of the Ivory’’, revealed an official from NRCN. Tomusange led the detectives to the residence of the diplomat, where a stand-off ensued, between the detectives and the Diplomat’s caretakers, who denied access. In the ensuing struggle for access to carry out a search, the caretakers released a guard dog which bit and injured one of the detectives on the left arm, before it was eventually subdued. In his statement to Police at Bugolobi Police Station, Mr Diego Marino did not deny that he was the owner of the Ivory pieces. Nonetheless, he says he had bought them several years ago from a hawker who he hasn’t identified. “I don’t sell Ivory. I have been here for over 10 years. I bought these things from a hawker here in Kampala”, Diego told the detectives from Bugolobi Police station. In Uganda though, offences related to trafficking in Wildlife are Strict Liability offences, meaning that regardless of what the defendant’s intents or mental state was when committing the act, possession of those materials can constitute criminal liability. The Officer in Charge Investigations at the Bugolobi Police station, James Mutaire, says Mr Diego Marino will be charged with 2 counts against wildlife. “We prefer 2 charges against him. One is Unlawful Possession of Specimen of Protected Wildlife contrary to Section 36 (1), and Section 71(1)(B) of the Uganda Wildlife Act, and secondly, Unlawful Transfer of Specimen of Protected Species contrary to Section 36(1) and Section 71 (1)(B) of the Uganda Wildlife Act”, said Mutaire. Exhibits On Monday, Experts from the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) joined the team of the Natural Resource Conservation Network (NRCN) to help with identification and prosecution of the suspects. In her 6 – page technical report dated April 13, 2021, an UWA Sergeant Major Twinamatsiko Harriet noted that she had confirmed that the 5.5Kgs of specimens handed to her by the police were actually of protected wildlife. “Having closely examined the features of the specimens as above and relating them with the known features of an Elephant and Hippopotamus, it was 99.9% highly probable that the specimens were 56 cut worked elephant Ivory pieces and one worked hippopotamus incisor tooth.” She said that her findings meant that at least 3 endangered animal species could have been killed to extract the pieces she observed. “At least two elephants died to obtain the specimens as described above considering the fact that an elephant has a pair of tusks and there were two complete worked tusks and several chopped ones. At least a hippopotamus died to obtain the one piece of the hippopotamus incisor tooth because the hippopotamus incisor belongs to the hippopotamus.

Two Vietnamese nationals, aged 32 and 44, were arrested Saturday at Luanda's 4 de Fevereiro International Airport for illegally possessing 84 kilograms of ivory packed in four suitcases.  The arrest took place as part of the operational plan to combat environmental crimes, such as illegal possession and sale of ivory, with two cases having been registered in less than two months, according to the director of the Institutional Communication and Press Office of the Directorate General of the Criminal Investigation (SIC).
Manuel Halaiwa, who presented the offenders yesterday at the SIC premises in Cacuaco, said that each individual was carrying 42 kilograms of ivory and the arrest took place when they intended to board the Emirates Airlines flight from Dubai, bound for Vietnam. He added that the investigations are continuing for the arrest of others involved, taking into account that it is assumed that the detainees were being used as mules (transporters of illegal cargo and/or drugs). ""This is not the first case we have reported regarding the seizure of ivory trophies and rhino horns. Last month we had a case corresponding to the trafficking of rhino horns,"" said Manuel Halaiwa. He added that traffickers use various methods to evade the authorities and the technology installed at the airport, using a series of undetectable material. ""To deceive the authorities, the detained individuals transformed the ivory into ornamental pieces (spheres to make necklaces) and used a type of special paper and plastic to make it difficult to detect the merchandise, in the technological system installed at the airport"", underlined the spokesperson. of the SIC. Manuel Halaiwa made it known that the authorities are working to discover the origin of the ivory and that the two Vietnamese will be referred to the Public Ministry within the next few hours.

The son of a former finance minister has been arrested alongside four others for trafficking in wildlife products. They were about to carry out an illegal transaction involving the sale of two ivory tusks when wildlife officials arrived the scene at the Omnisport neighbourhood in Yaounde. The arrest was done during the crackdown operation led by the Centre Regional Delegation for Forestry and Wildlife in collaboration with the Ngousso Gendarmerie Brigade in Yaounde. A nongovernmental organization called LAGA technically assisted the operation. The former finance minister’s son aged 44 transported the tusks in his black Toyota Prado car, accompanied by his accomplices to   the Omnisport neighourhood where they were just about to off load the ivory from the trunk of the car when gendarmes and wildlife officials swooped in and arrested all five.  The suspects were found in illegal possession of two big ivory tusks weighing over 50kg. According to eye witness accounts, one of the suspects sensing danger, attempted to pass through the dragnet. He slowly and confidently walked away from the scene but was quickly recognized, stopped and arrested alongside the others. The two ivory tusks were unusually big and weighed over 50kg indicating they were cut from a big elephant, something which is not very common today. Elephant tusks weighing over 20kg are difficult to find nowadays and some experts suggest this could be the result of intense poaching of elephant in the sub region with individuals in the various herds not allowed to grow to big enough sizes or are simply shot dead before they attain their full size. They also say this is also an indication of the fact that the elephant would have been killed in the savanna region because forest elephants have smaller ivory sizes.

A young couple was caught trafficking ivory on August 27, 2019 in Fougamou. The branch of the Judicial Police (PJ) in Ngounié has just made a big catch in Fougamou. A young woman and her husband were caught trafficking ivory spikes on 27 August. Aged 22, Marie-Laure Motambi Ngoubou and her lover Sylla Demba (24), were taken to Mouila and placed in custody at the PJ premises. The alleged traffickers will then be transferred to Libreville to be brought before the special panel of the Libreville Court. They face up to ten years in prison. Accompanied by elements of the Provincial Directorate of Water and Forests and the NGO Conservation Justice, the PJ agents were alerted by an anonymous source. Arriving in Fougamou in the early afternoon of August 27, it was around 3 p.m. that the team managed to arrest Marie-Laure Motambi Ngoubou, in possession of three ivory points that she was about to sell. The girl will try to exonerate herself, claiming not to know the contents of the cardboard in which the tips were hidden. The girl will eventually denounce her accomplice and lover. The latter will be apprehended in turn in the village, in Sindara, while he was waiting for the money from the sale. A new grip that questions the extent of ivory trafficking in the country.

Never Ndlovu (46) of Mambanje Village, Dete, found himself on the wrong side of the law after his refusal to hand back a school bicycle attracted the attention of police officers who stumbled on a stash of various animal trophies with a combined value of $47,500. He offered a partial plea when he appeared before Hwange Provincial magistrate, Portia Mhlanga facing five counts of unlawful possession of animal trophies. He argued that he had picked the trophies from the Hwange National Park while herding cattle and intended to use them for medicinal purposes. “Your worship, I do admit to the charge that the items were found in my bedroom hut, however, I did not kill those animals to get the trophies. Instead, I picked up all these things in the national park while herding cattle after I learnt that animal remains can be used to cure different ailments,” Ndlovu said. On November 9 last year, police officers were making a follow up on a bicycle belonging to Mambanje Primary School which Ndlovu, a former committee member, was refusing to surrender. Upon arrival, Ndlovu’s mother, Georgina, welcomed them into the homestead before informing them that her son was not at home. She led them to Ndlovu’s grass thatched bedroom hut where they recovered the bicycle in question. However, as the police officers were about to leave the room, one of them noticed a wild animal skin protruding from underneath Ndlovu’s bed and decided to investigate, whereupon he uncovered a female lion trophy. Suspecting more surprises, the two officers conducted through searches of the room and homestead, leading to the recovery of 16 pangolin scales valued at $5 000, a 3,5-metre-long python skin valued at $1 500, a female lion skin, three lion paws, lion teeth and baboon skull worth $20 500. Police also found raw ivory weighing 0,4kg valued at $20 000 and five class three wire snares. Upon being questioned on the ownership of the recovered animal trophies and wire snares, Georgina implicated his son. Loveness Maseko appeared for the State.

A suspected wildlife trafficker was arrested on April 12, 2019 in Meiganga with ivory and pangolin scales he was transporting on board a commercial bus. The man left Bertoua with the illegal products concealed inside a bag and boarded a bus to Ngaoundere but was stopped by customs at a check point some 10 km to Meiganga. Customs requested everyone in the bus to alight and identify their luggage. The owner of one the luggage was very reticent to own up to his luggage and upon verification it was discovered that the 42-year-old man owned the bag. When the bag was ripped open, he declared that the ivory tusks were cow horns in an attempt to trick customs officials but wildlife officials who were part of the team immediately recognized the products as ivory and pangolin scales. He was immediately arrested by the team comprised customs, gendarmes and wildlife officials. At the gendarmerie brigade where he was kept in custody, the contents of the bag revealed he had 24kg of ivory and 12kg of pangolin scales which investigations show he intended to sell in Ngoaundere. He was presented to the state counsel who remanded him in custody. Customs officials would later transfer the case file to wildlife officials who are handling the procedures aimed at ensuring the trafficker is prosecuted according to the law. A prosecution file has been established against the suspect and an international nongovernmental organization called LAGA technically assisted customs and wildlife officials in the process. This falls within the framework of the protocol agreement recently signed between LAGA and the customs department to assist authorities in the fight against cross border wildlife crime.

A gang of 17 suspected ivory smugglers have been arrested for possession of 10 elephant tusks, Shenzhen Customs announced during a press conference last Thursday. The ivory seized is said to be of African origin and weighs about 323.7 kilograms in total. The suspects were attempting to smuggle the illegal animal parts from Hong Kong into the Chinese mainland. The suspects, which include six Hong Kong residents, have now been detained for further investigation, according to China Daily. Shenzhen Customs described this as a ‘major ivory-smuggling case’ and said that they became aware of the group’s presence in 2017, when a similar case was being investigated in Zhanjiang, another city in Guangdong. The group had been using highly stealthy and sophisticated communication lines during their operation, making the case a hard nut to crack. Although customs agents teamed up with police from multiple cities, including Shenzhen, Maoming, Zhuhai, Fuzhou and Hong Kong, it wasn’t until this July, after two raids were carried out, that the joint police force managed to seal off this smuggling channel.

Seventeen suspects, including six Hong Kong residents, were detained for further investigation, according to Ma Dongsheng, a senior customs officer with the anti-smuggling bureau of Shenzhen Customs. ""A major smuggling channel that used to be active in smuggling African ivory to the mainland has been destroyed after a major smuggling gang was busted during the operation,"" Ma told a news conference on Thursday. Led by the General Administration of Customs, a special task force was set up after customs officers in Zhanjiang, Guangdong, seized smuggled ivory late last year. A gang of smugglers, including members from the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong, are suspected of taking African ivory into Guangdong via Hong Kong, Ma said. The task force consisted of customs officers from Shenzhen, Zhanjiang and Fuzhou, Fujian province.

Anamalai Tiger Reserve (ATR) officials, along with Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), seized a pair of elephant tusks on Tuesday. Six persons, including an anti-poaching watcher, were arrested. According to sources, the accused have been identified as P Manikandan (38), owner of a pet shop, K Samiyappan, an anti-poaching watcher at Pollachi forest range in ATR, A Kathavarayan, a sanitary worker, M Sikkanthar Basha, footwear shopkeeper, K Sharathi a grove labourer, and A Nandhakumar, who works as a lab assistant at a private college. Following a tip-off about the tusks being sold through a pet shop near Shanmugapuram, a team of WCCB and forest staff, disguised as buyers, confirmed that the accused were selling the tusks. After grilling the shopkeeper, Manikandan, he confessed that Samiyappan and Kathavarayan had collected the tusks from the forest in Pollachi during their routine patrolling and kept it in a grove with the help of Sharathi and Sikkanthar. Subsequently, Manikandan decided to sell through his friend Nandhakumar to potential buyers, sources said. Sources added that Samiyappan and Kathavarayan had found an elephant carcass inside Pollachi forest range and took its tusks on December 14. ""Age of the animal is suspected to be between 10 to 15 years, and it could have died a few months ago. After noticing the carcass at Vedikaranpallam in Pollachi forest range, the duo must have gone inside the forest without taking GPS on December 14 to collect the tusks,"" said Xavier Deputy Director of ATR S Arokiyaraj. ""The gang was waiting to get Rs 3 lakh by selling the tusks. They were carrying out the negotiation through WhatsApp. However they were caught within ten days. They were produced before the Pollachi Judicial Magistrate II and were remanded in Coimbatore Central Prison,"" he added.

The Forest Department have arrested six persons, including an anti-poaching watcher (APW), on charges of attempting to sell a pair of elephant tusks. Officials said on Wednesday that the six accused -- APW K. Samiyappan (30), a temporary worker with the Forest Department, A. Kathavarayan (50), brokers M. Sikendhar Basha (37), P. Manikandan (38) and A. Nanthakumar (39) and a security guard at a private farm K. Sarathi (67) were arrested on Tuesday evening. Investigations revealed that Samiyappan and Kathavarayan removed the tusks from a decomposed elephant carcass in the Pollachi forest range during a patrol. They intended to sell it to meet personal expenses, the officials said. They sought the help of Basha, who helped them bury the tusks in a private farm with the assistance of the security guard, Sarathi. The tusks were later stored at the pets shop with the help of brokers Manikandan and Nanthakumar.

Ivory traffickers have been caught with photographs on their phones showing them proudly posing next to the carcass of a dead elephant. Illegal wildlife trade enforcement agency, the Eagle Network, said the distressing images were found on the mobile of two men who were arrested in Congo on June 21. The photographs show a group of up to five or six men that can be seen posing with the head and carcass of an elephant. A man holds what appears to be an assault rifle - potentially the weapon used to kill the animal.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service launched the investigation in 2016, and it led to a search on Dec. 12 [2018] of a home in the 4700 block of Helmo Avenue occupied by Chang Xiong and his wife, Ma Chang. Search warrant documents unsealed Wednesday [02/01/2019] in federal court in St. Paul show that investigators seized seven rhino feet, five rhino toenails, a rhino horn and two wine cups, two walking stick handles, a snuff bottle and a ring, all made from rhino parts. They also seized a carved elephant tusk, an ivory figurine and two bracelets and a ring. Neither Xiong nor Chang has been charged with a crime. Darin Brandenburg, a special agent with the wildlife service based in Madison, Wis., outlined the investigation in a statement to support the warrant. Brandenburg wrote that it began May 11, 2016, when a source who runs a taxidermy business in the United Kingdom sent U.S. authorities an e-mail indicating that Xiong had tried to buy a rhinoceros foot. He said the source explained to Xiong that it would be illegal to ship the foot to the U.S., but he sent him Brandenburg’s covert e-mail address, indicting that he might be able to help. Brandenburg said Xiong sent him an e-mail looking for rhino feet and continued his pursuit of the contraband even after being told that they had to be careful to avoid getting into trouble. Xiong said he had bought a rhino foot in April 2016 from a seller in Florida without any trouble. They eventually agreed to meet at a Home Depot parking lot in Hudson, Wis., to make a deal. Xiong and Chang arrived at the lot in July 2016 in a black Mercedes, Brandenburg said. After Chang inspected a rhino foot that was secretly marked with “fluorescent invisible detection paste,” Xiong paid Brandenburg $1,100. State and federal investigators followed the couple back to their home in the 1900 block of Montana Avenue E. in St. Paul, where they lived at the time, and watched them unload the foot. In November 2016, Customs and Border Protection agents intercepted a 24-pound shipment of elephant toenails, bone and two small unidentified animal horns. They released the shipment and it was delivered to Xiong at his St. Paul address. He arranged another covert sale to Xiong of a rhinoceros foot for $1,100 in September 2017. “Xiong inspected the foot and said he was going to display it in his house,” Brandenburg wrote. “I asked Xiong how many rhinoceros feet he had now. Xiong replied saying he only had the two he had bought from me. … Chang said she had eight relatives so she wanted me to find a rhinoceros foot for each of them. Chang also said she wanted a rhinoceros foot for each of her four children.”  Chang, who is from Thailand, explained that rhinoceros parts are good luck. Xiong immigrated to the U.S. more than 20 years ago from Laos. In the Hmong culture, Brandenburg wrote, “rhinoceros parts and elephant ivory are symbols of wealth and prosperity.”  Authorities inspected a package shipped to Xiong from the United Kingdom in January 2018 that contained a rhinoceros foot.  Brandenburg said he arranged another sale of two more rhinoceros feet in December for $1,600.  In addition, he said, Xiong bought an elephant tusk through a Canadian auction firm and it was shipped to him with a customs form declaring it as plastic.

In its relentless drive against smuggling of wildlife and animal body parts, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (Kolkata) busted a syndicate involved in smuggling of Elephant tusks and Tiger teeth on Sunday and Monday. About 12 kilos of Elephant tusks and five pieces of Tiger teeth - cumulatively valued at Rs 1.147 crores - were recovered and seized. Three persons were arrested. The recovery and seizure coincided with the Global Tiger Day. DRI had learnt that a Kolkata-based syndicate headed by a man called Habibullah is smuggling Elephant tusks, ivory articles, Tiger teeth and other animal parts out of India and to various countries like Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar. The export of animal body parts are prohibited for export under the provisions of Foreign Trade Policy, Customs Act, 1962 read with Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. Acting on the intelligence, DRI sleuths intercepted Muslima Begum, second wife of Habibullah on Sunday at Sealdah Railway Station with two pieces of Elephant tusks weighing 4.27 kilograms which she had brought from Assam, concealed inside her side bag, under the instructions of her husband. She was about to hand over the same to her husband at the station itself. Immediate interrogation of the husband-wife duo and quick follow-up actions by DRI resulted in recovery of one piece of ivory bangle and another ivory piece from the flat of their son-in-law Adil Hussain in Park Circus area along with five pieces of Tiger teeth and 29 pieces of assorted ivory and some mechanical instruments along with Rs 1,48,000 in cash.

The elephant population in Tanzania, famed for its wildlife reserves, shrank from 110,000 in 2009 to barely 43,000 in 2014, according to a 2015 census, with conservation groups blaming rampant poaching. The government says numbers have now started to recover. Demand for ivory from Asian countries such as China and Vietnam, where it is turned into jewels and ornaments, has driven the surge in poaching across Africa. Hamisi Kigwangalla, minister for Natural Resources and Tourism, said on his Twitter account late on Wednesday the ivory was recovered after authorities arrested suspected “hardcore” poacher Hassan Shaban Likwema, also known by the alias Hassan Nyoni. “The arrest of Nyoni has brought us to a stage where we can say we have taken into custody all the hardcore poachers on our wanted list, except for a few who have left the country,” Kigwangalla said. “Nyoni and his accomplices’ consignment is worth 4 billion shillings ($1.74 million) and involved the killing of 117 elephants going back to 2015 and earlier,” he said. Neither Likwema nor his accomplices were immediately reachable for comment.

An international poaching syndicate, whose member was arrested during Ops Khazanah recently, is believed to have used AK47 rifles and wire snares to hunt endangered species. Sources said the syndicate, with members comprising locals and those from neighbouring countries, has been active in hunting wildlife and collecting their parts in Kelantan jungles for more than three years. The source said the poachers have targeted endangered species such as tigers, elephants and sun bears. ""The Kelantan international poaching syndicate has at least 10 members and the rich profits from the business prompted them to sell different parts of the animals on the black market,"" the source told the New Straits Times. The source said the finding was made following the seizure of a tiger, panther carcasses and 10 pieces of ivory worth more than RM500,000 during the operation in Tanah Merah. ""With the arrest of the suspect and the seizure of the carcasses and the ivory, police believe organised criminals are behind these cruel acts. ""The hunters set up the wire snares in the jungles and later kill the animals, mostly for their parts. ""The authorities involved in the operation are now tracking down the rest of the syndicate members who they believe are still in the state,"" said the source. The source said it is believed that a tiger is sold for its skin, bones, teeth, claws, tail and even whiskers which can find a place on the black market as decorative items or ingredients in traditional medicines. A 25-year-old man, believed to be a member of the syndicate, was arrested in the 3am operation and was remanded for four days beginning yesterday. Investigations showed that the carcasses and ivory had been kept at a premises since April and were to be sent to their intended destinations soon.

The Education for Nature-Vietnam (ENV) said on February 21 that 19 wild animals of rare and threatened species were rescued from illegal traders and trappers, and subsequently released back into nature in January. Eight animals were handed over voluntarily by local people – consisting of two pangolins, one red-shanked douc langur, one python, and four monkeys – and taken to either nature reserves or released back into nature. The ENV said that competent authorities also seized many wild animal products, including 9.94kg of elephant tusks in Vinh Phuc province. It also detected and worked to remove 54 online pages that contained illegal wildlife trading information. According to ENV Vice Director Bui Thi Ha, the result is a vivid illustration of the radical change in public awareness of wildlife protection. Strict punishment must be meted out to any violations in order to prevent such crimes, she suggested. As advertisements for and the illegal trading of wildlife animals on the Internet are common violations, competent authorities should enhance control to ban wrongdoers from using social networking platforms to sell wild animals, Ha said. Some 521 endangered wildlife animals were saved in Vietnam in 2018 thanks to the engagement of people and law enforcement agencies. Up to 1,666 wildlife-related violations were also detected, of which 64 percent were involved in illegally advertising and trading endangered animals and related products.

The forest officials on Friday arrested a 64-year-old tribal man in connection with a case of ivory seizure at Adimaly in Idukki. The arrested was Purushothaman of Kurathikudy tribal settlement at Adimaly. According to Forest department officials, a pair of ivory tusks weighing 9 kg was seized from the possession of the accused. The ivory tusks were seized by the Forest intelligence wing. Adimaly range officer Joji James and Devikulam range officer P.V. Vegi, led the team. The Forest department officials approached the accused as ivory tusk buyers. The accused had hidden the ivory tusks inside a sack behind his house. According to officials, in his statement to the forest, the accused said that two people, Balan and Unni from the Elamblassery settlement, had handed over the ivory tusks to him around six months before. The accused was produced before the Adimaly Judicial First Class Magistrate Court on Saturday and has been remanded to judicial custody. “The probe is going on, and more accused will be arrested soon,” said a Forest department official. According to Forest department officials, the forest road connecting Elamblassery, near Neriamangalam in Ernakulam, that passes through Kurathikudy tribal settlement to Mankulam tourist destination, was recently opened for the public. “After the road’s opening, the entry of outsiders has increased in the Kurathikudy tribal settlement, resulting in increased crime incidents. The illegal entry of tourists in the reserve forest area is also a threat to wild elephants including animals,” said a senior Forest department official.

In a joint operation with their Kerala counterparts, the Karnataka Forest Department recently busted what it said was a gang of poachers operating from Elachivali in Attappadi in the Palakkad district of Kerala. Following the covert operation, the Kerala Forest Department arrested five men and seized wildlife trophies — including leopard, sloth bear, and wild boar teeth, two elephant tusks, a bottle of animal fat, and a piece of sandalwood — from them. Three of the arrested four have been identified as Sibi Kaidukuli (57), a resident of Elachivali and a farmer with a banana plantation on eight acres; Asghar Pasha (37), a painter from Melathur in Malappuram, and Yousthas Khan (40), a furniture businessman from Pandikadu in Malappuram. The other two are Anil and Sibi’s aide Rajesh. The search party also seized four locally-made muzzleloaders, 10 machetes, three bags of gunpower weighing 5 kg, and other combustible substances from them. The local police invoked the Arms Act and the Explosive Substances Act while booking them. Thunderbolts, the Kerala police’s elite commando unit, were also alerted since Maoists have often surfaced in Attappadi. A Karnataka Forest CID probe led to the arrest of the four men. The CID was in pursuit of ivory artefacts being smuggled from Mysuru. Forest Department officials said on Saturday, 16 December, that the ivory carvers — migrants from south and central Kerala —  were under surveillance. Several such carvers had migrated to Karnataka between 2015 and 2017, they added. “It is their traditional occupation. They came on our radar and we started arresting those involved in the illegal ivory carving business,” a senior forest official told South First. “Migrants from Kerala in and around Mysuru were initially into wood-carving. Since huge money is involved in ivory carving, they established a network of agents in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, who supplied them with ivory,” said the officer. “They mostly carved idols of gods, which were in high demand in North India. Families in North India offer ivory idols of Hindu gods as dowry so that they are passed on to the next generations,” he explained. Pasha, who supplied ivory to artisans, had been under the Karnataka Forest CID’s surveillance. The officials had information that he was dealing with ivory artefacts worth lakhs of rupees. They also learnt that Asghar was in touch with Sibi in Kerala. In the first week of December, Karnataka and Kerala forest departments conducted a joint sting operation and sent a decoy as a customer to Sibi’s house to buy an ivory artefact. Subsequently, four men were arrested, while Anil escaped. However, a special investigation team of the Kerala Forest Department arrested him from his house and seized two country-made muzzleloaders from him. Officials in the search party said Sibi’s house looked like a blacksmith or a gunsmith’s workshop. The trophies seized from Sibi’s house were sent for forensic examination. Meanwhile, an NIA team might visit Attappadi following the seizure of firearms and ammunition.

Three men made a court appearance on Friday for a Case Management Conference (CMC) regarding the alleged possession of an elephant tusk. According to the charge sheet, Thusego Masisi, 34, Onneetse Molefhe, 34, and Maxwell Fanikiso, 37, were allegedly found in possession of a 12.6 kg elephant tusk near Nzano Mall in Francistown on March 27, 2020. The charge specifies that they had no permit or licence for the possession of the tusk, which was being transported in a BWM car with registration B 239 BEM and valued at P24,000. During the court proceedings, Masisi's attorney, Mongiwethu Nehwati, conveyed that her client, upon arrest, had the chance to inspect the tusk at the police station. At that time, it was broken but not cut at its tip, as it is currently presented in court. In response, Molefhe stated he had nothing to add, while Fanikiso echoed Masisi's sentiments. Meanwhile, when the court went to Kutlwano Police Station for an inspection in loco (to enable the cort to observe real evidence in addition to oral evidence), Nehwati reminded the court that a previous order granted the car owner teh right to possess but not sell the vehicle until the conclusion of the case. As per the law, if it's proven beyond reasonable doubt that the BMW was unlawfully transporting the tusk, it will be forfeited to the state. The trio is scheduled to appear in court on February 1, 2024, for the continuation of the trial before Principal Magistrate Tshepo Magetse.

The City Crime Branch (CCB) of Bengaluru police arrested four people for allegedly trying to sell items that were made of elephant ivory. The cops recovered the ivory material of 7.5 kilograms from the accused and seized all the materials. Apart from ivory, the cops also recovered various articles that are made using the body parts of wildlife species. In a tweet, the official handle of the CCB department said, “Based on information received, the CCB police squad arrested 04 people who attempted to sell articles made of elephant ivory within Halasuru Gate PS limits and recovered 7.5 kilograms of ivory.” Police also found bracelets, door handles and even walking sticks that are made from various species' body parts. “A bracelet, boxes, door handles, irregular artwork, a knife made of deer, amber containing a scorpion, walking sticks, elephant idols and other valuables were seized from the accused,” said another tweet. In August this year, customs officials in Kempegowda International Airport at Bengaluru rescued sixty Indian star tortoises which were stuffed in a check-in bag. All the threatened species were reportedly supposed to reach Bangkok from Bengaluru and customs sleuths arrested the accused for alleged involvement in smuggling. Reptiles have regularly been smuggled to Bangkok as the demand for Indian reptiles has skyrocketed in Southeast Asian nations.

Shillong: In a major blow to animal trafficking in the state, Meghalaya Forest Department busted an organised trafficking racket from the house of an Assam Rifles’ jawan and seized live animals and articles of endangered species in large numbers in two separate incidents. On receipt of a specific input on April 19, a joint team of the forest department, Meghalaya Police and Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), led by Arul Mathuram, Divisional Forest Officer, Khasi Hills Wildlife Division, raided the house of Victorious Masharing at Khliehumstem village in Ri-Bhoi district. The team found 44.64 kg scales of Chinese Pangolin, four live Chinese Pangolins and 43 Tokay Geckos. An electronic weighing scale used to weigh the animals, utensils used to keep the live Pangolins, seven mobile phones, Rs 25,500 in cash, one brown colour bag and three vehicles bearing registration numbers AS 025 -0127, ML-10 A -9330 and ML 10 C 4056 parked in the house were also recovered. Apart from Masharing, who is an Assam Rifles jawan, seven other persons, identified as Pynshngianlang Sten, Fieldstar Lyngdoh, Banker Ronghang, Darwin Phangcho, Edison Teron, Klinson Bey and Siparlin Rani were also present in the house. The team arrested all the eight persons. After completion of the raid, they brought the arrested persons along with the seized articles to Shillong. According to a statement, the Tokay Geckos were packed in bamboo pieces in an inhumane condition. One of the live Pangolins was severely injured and even after providing the best possible care by the Department Veterinarian succumbed to the injuries before it could be released in the wild after obtaining permission from the Court. The Sessions Judge, Ri-Bhoi District, Nongpoh remanded all the eight persons to judicial custody for seven days. In another incident, on April 20, the forest department received information about a consignment of elephant tusks being transported through Patharkhmah–Umling Road. Accordingly, a joint team of Nongpoh Wildlife Range, Nongpoh Police Station, and the WCCB laid a trap at Umling. At about 9.30 PM, the team arrested two persons namely, Pyndap Wahlang and Last Sylliang and recovered two elephant tusks, having a total weight of about 3.3 kg from a Maruti Alto 800 car bearing registration Number ML 10 C 2505. On enquiry, they could not produce any documentary evidence to support the lawful possession of these tusks. The team, therefore, seized both these tusks and car along with two mobile phones in possession of these two accused. The team also arrested both Wahlang and Sylliang and brought them to the Nongpoh Wildlife Range along with the seized articles. Further investigation to find out the origin and potential buyers in both the incident is in progress.

The arrested persons were identified as Parmeshwar Prajapati of Kushinisf village, Bhaiyalal Maurya and Dharmlala Maurya of Atrauli village in Ghorawal area of the district, he added. The tusks were 10.60 kg in weight. The cost of the tusks was estimated at Rs 2.50 crores in the international market. During investigation, it surfaced that they had brought the tusks from Singrauli and were taking it to Varanasi to deliver it to some person. He said, “Names of two more persons in their syndicate have come to light and police teams have been engaged for their arrest.” Earlier, two wildlife smugglers had also been arrested with eight kilogrammes of elephant tusks at Telibagh area under Chetganj police station. In other cases like recovery of 13 kilogrammes elephant tusks by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence sleuths from a person arrested in West Bengal, it had come to light that the consignment was being taken to Varanasi from Assam in February 2020. However, despite the recent arrest of wildlife smugglers and their revelation that elephant tusks were being taken to Varanasi, the cops and other agencies have so far failed to identify the people or syndicates in Varanasi involved in the ivory trade.

The magistrate of the District Principal Magistrate’s Court, Ms Nurupudensia Nassary, issued the sentence last Thursday saying the court had been satisfied with evidence submitted before it. Magistrate Nassary said following evidence produced before the court, the suspect has been convicted beyond reasonable doubt. “After you have been found guilty, the court is sentencing you to 20 years jail. However, the door is open for appeal within 30 days for the side which is not satisfied by the ruling,” she said. Mkombola, who is a pastor with the Anglican Church Tanzania, was arrested on October 26, last year in Mingui Village allegedly in possession of two elephant tusks worth Sh69.15 million. Reading the charge sheet earlier, Police Public Prosecutor Wilson Mwita told the court that the suspect was charged with two counts of possessing government trophies and economic sabotage. He demanded before the court that the suspect committed the offence contrary to Section 86 (i)(ii) of the Wildlife Conservation Act Cap 5 of 2009 and Article 14 (d) table 57 (1) of economic sabotage as revised in 2002. Mr Mwita prayed the court to issue stern punishment in order to server as a lesson to servants of God and general public that engage in such illegal dealings. However, defence lawyer Sostenes Mseligwa asked the court to reduce the punishment to his client because it was the first time he committed the offence. Also, he said his client had a wife and children who depended on him and that he constituted the country’s human resource because he was still young. Speaking after the judgement, Mr Mseligwa said he was planning to appeal in order to ensure justice takes its coursed for his client.

Forest Department officials from Chennai aided by their Vellore counterparts successfully nabbed two persons from Chennai who attempted to sell them an elephant tusk, on Wednesday evening. Officials said that Satish Kumar (39) and Jayakumar (38) both of Nerkundarm in Chennai were involved in the sale of animal related artifacts. Satish Kumar already had cases pending on similar issues with the Forest Department. Chennai forest officials learnt that the duo planned to sell an elephant tusk and as Satish Kumar was already on their radar the department tracked them using the former’s mobile phone location. Forest officials then approached the duo in the guise of wanting to purchase the tusk. They were told to come to Vellore as both were in that town. Hence, on Wednesday evening Chennai forest officials arrived in Vellore and when they contacted Satish Kumar he told them to come to Sathumadurai, on the outskirts of the town on the Tiruvannamalai highway. Chennai officials accompanied by their local counterparts went to the spot in plain clothes and started talking to them when others who were in hiding nabbed them. Officials said that the duo demanded Rs 23 lakh for the 20 kg tusk. Both have been remanded to custody.

A 34-year-old man was arrested with two elephant tusks in Subhanpura area of the city on Thursday. Acting on a tip off, the Vadodara forest department along with the Vadodara police laid down a trap and visited the accused, Vinayak Purohit, at his residence as dummy customers. Purohit was caught red-handed while trying to sell the tusks. According to the police, Purohit informed them that his grandfather had brought the tusks from Africa in the late 1960s. Since he was facing financial crisis, he had decided to sell them and fetch a hefty price. The police are, however, yet to ascertain these facts. The two tusks weighing around 2 kg each and 110 cm long have been seized by the forest department and have been sent for testing. Police have booked him under relevant sections of the Wildlife Protection Act and are carrying out investigations to ascertain the facts. “The tusks have been sent for examination to check exactly how old are they and if the claims are true. Depending upon the results, we will take the investigation further if any more persons were involved and where he exactly got the tusks,” a police official said.

Antiques worth around Rs 100 crore were seized from the house of a businessman in Deganga in West Bengal’s North 24 Parganas district, TV9 Bharatvarsh reported. The officials from the Administration General and Welfare Trustee’s office, who conducted the raid earlier on Friday and recovered the items, claimed that it was West Bengal’s largest antique operation. Antiques worth around Rs 100 crore were seized from the house of a businessman in Deganga in West Bengal’s North 24 Parganas district, TV9 Bharatvarsh reported.  Among the materials recovered were elephant tusks, deer legs, statues of ancient gods, and a variety of other items from the Mauryan and Kushan periods. The officials said the combined market value of the recovered items is estimated to be around Rs 100 crore. The businessman named Asaduzzaman lives in Hadipur with his wife and three daughters.

The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) officials came to know that Asaduzzaman, who runs a business of flower shops, had kept these artefacts with him during the fair at Chandraketugarh. Biplab Roy, the current Administrator General and Official Trustee of West Bengal, learned from Asaduzzaman’s neighbours that he has amassed a collection of over 15,000 artefacts. Roy approached him after learning of this information and introduced himself as an antiques collector. After a while, the businessman led Roy to his godown, where the officials arrived and the antiques were confiscated.

ZAMBEZI regional police arrested two Zambian nationals for possession of 15 elephant tusks in the Kapani area of the Linyanti constituency on Sunday. The two Zambian nationals, aged 29 and 32, were part of a group of seven, however, five escaped with hunting rifles. Regional police spokesperson inspector Kisco Sitali confirmed the arrest to The Namibian on Monday. He said the suspected transnational armed poachers were intercepted while on their way back from Botswana with the elephant tusks. “After our successful bust of 24 elephant tusks on Friday, we have intensified our joint security cluster operation in the area. It is now evident with these arrests that our suspicion was right that the poachers will continue to use the routes to smuggle the elephant tusks from Botswana to Zambia,” he said. The police are hard at work to find and arrest the suspects who fled the scene, Sitali said. Sunday’s arrests follow the bust of 24 elephant tusks on Friday, when a Namibian driver was arrested in the Batubaja area and seven Zambian nationals fled the scene. The driver claims that he was only called to transport passengers but did not know that they were in possession of elephant tusks. He is expected to appear in the Katima Mulilo Magistrates Court on Monday, while the suspects arrested on Sunday will appear in court this week.

Sources said that Alipurduar resident Manikant Gowala, who was carrying the tusk weighing 3kg, was also arrested. Following a tip-off, a team of foresters of Belakoba range led by ranger Sanjay Dutta conducted a raid near Tinbatti More located on the outskirts of the city. “When we reached the spot, we saw three persons bargaining beside an eatery. We tried to catch all of them, but two managed to flee. We, however, managed to arrest Gowala,” said, a source. The foresters found Gowala had the tusk inside a gunny bag that he had on him. “The tusk weighs 3kg. We asked him to show relevant documents that allowed him to carry wildlife body parts. When he failed to produce any, we arrested him under Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972,” said the official. During the preliminary probe, the foresters came to know that an elephant was recently killed in a forest in Assam. “The tusk was procured from that elephant and a deal of Rs 15 lakh had been struck for it,” said an official.

The Lampung Police have arrested three individuals who were allegedly engaged in illegal elephant ivory trade in the region. Lampung Police spokesperson Comr. Zahwani Pandra Arsyad said the suspects – identified as BT, TW and AS – had been apprehended in a hotel in Pringsewu regency on Wednesday. “Our officers received information that an illegal transaction involving elephant ivory was about to take place. Following an investigation, the three perpetrators were indeed planning to sell tusks,” Pandra said on Thursday as quoted by kompas.com. After confirming the trade, a joint team consisting of the Lampung Police’s general crimes unit and personnel from the South Bukit Barisan National Park (TNBBS) was deployed to foil the illicit activity. Police seized two tusks as evidence, each measuring about 50 centimeters, and said all three suspects were being questioned about the origin of the tusks. In addition, police confiscated nine ivory smoking pipes and three unprocessed elephant teeth. The suspects were charged under Articles 21 and 40 of Law. 5/1900 on the conservation of natural resources and ecosystems. “They face up to five years in prison and a fine of Rp 100 million (US$6,721),” Pandra said. The government has stepped up its measures to crack down on illegal ivory trade in recent years. In April, investigators from the Environment and Forestry Ministry arrested three individuals on suspicion of illegal online trade in ivory and other products from elephants and other endangered animals. The trio allegedly sold jewelry and other accessories like cigarette holders through three separate Facebook accounts.

Deccan Chronicle; 2020-09-02
The allegation by animal lovers that Odisha is a happy hunting ground for elephant poachers has once again received credence as the state forest department officials on Monday night seized around 19 kg of elephant tusks from a car near Bayapita village under Harichandanpur police limits in Keonjhar district. Three persons, all ivory traders, were arrested in this connection. According to reports, the officials, acting on a tip-off about the smuggling of the tusks in the car, chased the vehicle and intercepted it near Bayapita village. On searching the car, the tusks were recovered from the vehicle. The accused were being questioned to ascertain the possible involvement of others in the offence. According to Dr Biswajit Mohanty, an eminent wildlife activist, poachers are indulging in mindless killing of tuskers in the state to extract their teeth. The state government, on the other hand, has not been able to contain such ghastly act because of inadequate focus on the grave issue. “Despite Odisha being criticised outside for the rising number of elephant deaths, mostly tuskers, the state forest department has not been able to crack down the poachers and traders. Unless the state government wakes up to nail the poachers, the elephant population here will cease to exist,” said Dr Mohanty. Although the state government is arresting poachers from time to time, the killers are being acquitted due to the weak investigation process by the forest officials. Dr Mohanty, who is secretary of Wildlife Society of Odisha, urged the state government to hand over the arrested poachers to the Special Task Force for an effective probe. Of the 784 elephant deaths in Odisha in the last 10 years and four months, 114 were killed by poachers, primarily for Ivory.

They are Hussein Seif, alias Kawambwa, alias Mizumizumi, who is a resident of Kisarawe in Coast Region, Ally Mpalupalu, a resident of Chanika in Dar es Salaam, Adam Mohamed, who resides at Kilwa Masoko in Lindi Region and Nganya Mkanyage, a resident of Bagamoyo in Coast Region. The accused persons were arraigned before two magistrates in different court chambers to face four economic charges. They were not allowed to enter plea to the charges because they fall under the Economic and Organised Crime Control Act. Investigations into the two cases, according to the prosecution, led by State Attorneys Kijja Luzungana and Faraji Nguka, have not been completed. The prosecution alleged before Senior Resident Magistrate Rashid Chaungu, Seif and Mpalupalu committed the offences on March 23, 2021 in the city. The court heard that on the material date at Gongo la Mboto area in the city of Dar es Salaam, the two accused persons were found in possession of four pieces of elephant tusks, all valued at 173,248,500/-, [74,632.5 USD as of 03/29/2021] the property of the government, without permit from the Director of Wildlife. It is alleged that on the same date [March 23, 2021] and place, the two accused persons were found dealing in government trophies in that they trafficked the elephant tusks without having any permit from the Wildlife Director. The prosecution told the court before Principal Resident Magistrate Huruma Shaidi that on March 13, 2021 at Mbagala Rangi Tatu in Temeke District, Mohamed and Mkanyage were found possessing one leopard skin, worth 8, 0834,258/- [34,822 USD as of 03/29/2021] property of the government, without permit. It is alleged that on the same date [March 23, 2021] and place in the region of Dar es Salaam, the two accused persons were found dealing in government trophies, in that, they trafficked the leopard skin without having any valid permit from the Director of Wildlife. Magistrate Shaidi granted bail to the duo on condition of securing two reliable sureties each and that every surety must have an identification letter and sign bond of 5m/- [2,153.91 USD as of 03/29/2021]. One of the sureties, according to the magistrate, must surrender in court a title deed of immovable property worth of such amount. None of them managed to meet the bail conditions. On part of Seif and Mpalupalu, Magistrate Chaungu directed them to seek bail to the High Court if they so wished because his court lacked jurisdiction as the amount involved exceeds 10m/- [4,307.83 USD as of 03/29/2021]. Under such circumstances, all accused persons were ordered to go to remand and the two cases were adjourned to April 13, 2021 for mention, pending further investigations into the matters.

Kumar Ashish, conservator of Palamu forest has confirmed the death of the tusker and claimed that both its tusks were missing. Ashish said the tusker was found dead last night itself and the officials were combing the area. The site of the death is in Renchi, the protected forest of Balumath in Latehar district which also falls close to the district of Chatra. Notably, it was the same tusker that was earlier found limping and had undergone a long treatment on its left hind leg. Touring veterinary officer Dr Ajay Kumar was specially brought down to the jungles of Renchi from Bokaro for his treatment under orders of the state government. Sources said Dr Ajay Kumar did his best and the tusker began to recover fast but now it is dead and both its tusks missing. This point showcases that the tusker was killed by poachers for its tusks. However, officials have claimed that they are not sure whether the tusker was killed for its tusks or was it after its death that the tusks were removed. A lagatar24.com correspondent spoke to one of the doctors, Dr V S Dubey, also a 2012 batch IFS officer, who performed the post-mortem on Sunday. Dr Dubey said the tusker had no external injury or wound. There were no scars or holes in its body. Explaining the reason for its demise, Dr Dubey said, “There was definitely internal injury. It was severe. There was a pool of blood inside the body.” The internal injury was near the mammary glands of the tusker. The bleeding was very profuse, Dr Dubey added. He said the tusker had a deformity of the leg. Its left hind leg was shorter than its right hind leg. Dr Dubey further added that the left hind leg was shorter by 3 inches. Dr Dubey feared that the serious internal bleeding might have led the tusker to go into shock that led to its death. Conservator Ashish said, “The poachers removed the tusks after the elephant’s death. The location where this elephant was found dead is beyond the territory of the PTR. Sources said Dr Ajay Kumar and Dr R Jojo had taken utmost care of its treatment. Apart from Dr V S Dubey who performed the post mortem there were others namely Dr R Jojo, Dr Om Prakash Sahu, Dr S Kullu and Dr S Kasi who were in the team of Dr Dubey while the post mortem was performed.

The targets of Operation Airâvata (named after an elephant god in Hindu mythology) were investigated for international trafficking in elephant ivory. Police found more than 200 ivory objects and about 35 fossils in an antique store. The PF action took place in partnership with the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama) and the Environmental Police of the State of São Paulo. This operation was an offshoot of Operation Thunder last year. IBAMA identified among the pieces found those that are the teeth of wild animals, such as elephant ivory. No crude parts were found, but objects such as necklaces, bracelets, pendants and statues. The authorities estimate that the added value of the pieces found exceeds R$ 500 thousand. Brazil is a signatory to an international treaty that prohibits the sale of endangered animals. In this case, Asian and African elephants. Due to trafficking, pieces that use ivory need to be accompanied by specific documentation proving that the material used has a regular origin. None of the parts found by the PF had the required paperwork. Combating ivory trafficking is an extremely important environmental action. According to the head of the Federal Police's Crimes Against the Environment Precinct, Sebastião Pujol, the illegal trade in parts that use elephant teeth leads to the extermination of hundreds of animals a day for profit from the sale of parts. Ibama fined the violators at R$5,000 per item found. The operation targeted a commercial establishment and a residence of the same person, a merchant who has a shop selling semi precious stones and antiques in general. In addition, the investigated man has an activity in the educational area. There was no arrest in the act. During the press conference, when asked if the products were being marketed as if it were something “normal”, the delegate implied that they were. “It would be good for people to be aware that the end consumer is collaborating directly with a chain of commerce that results from the slaughter of animals that are endangered, which are elephants,” he says. The delegate recalled that, in the first phase of the investigation, materials were found that used ivory in their manufacture in a craft fair in the open space of the Museum of Modern Art of São Paulo (MASP). The people found there were directly linked to the merchant, something of the Airâvata action.

Later, the team confirmed that poachers from Meghalaya killed the elephant for meat. Veterinary doctor Dr Narayan Dewri and field assistant Ashim Das, who conducted the post-mortem of the elephant, said the elephant died 15 days ago. The animal, however, was buried at the site. Locals of the area alleged that sounds of gunshots are mostly heard in the night hours in the forest reserve area. “Although people have informed about it to the nearest forest office, the forest department never took any action against it,” one of the locals claimed.

Kanchanaburi forensic police have found five shotgun pellets embedded in the remains of an elephant in Salak Phra wildlife sanctuary in the province, but they do not believe that they were the cause of the animal’s demise. Police used a metal detector to scan the remains of the elephant, which is thought to have died weeks ago, and detected the presence of metal pieces lodged 1-2cm under its skin. The five metal pieces were identified as lead shot from a 12-gauge shotgun cartridge, but police do not believe that they killed the elephant because the wounds had already healed. Police said, however, that poachers had cut into the skull of the elephant to remove its tusks. Meanwhile, veterinarians from the sanctuary in Muang district collected bone and tissue samples for lab tests to determine the cause of death. Officials from the sanctuary have been collecting evidence to enable them to file a complaint with the police.

Customs at Cairo International Airport have thwarted an attempt to smuggle three ivory statues that are prohibited from being exported or traded. The statues were seized, preventing their export in a shipment of personal belongings to Lebanon. Legal measures are underway in accordance with Presidential Decree No. 102 of 1983 to implement Egypt’s accession to the CITES convention and Egyptian Environmental Law No. 4 of 1994, and its amendments. Ahmed Abdel Mohsen El-Shahawi, director general of Air Export Customs, executed the legal measures and issued a seizure report, implementing instructions from the head of the Customs Authority. Customs officers led by El-Shahawi were able to intercept the smuggling attempt.

Shanghai Customs uncovered a case in which an importer had failed to declare that a batch of pianos had keys made of ivory, officers said on Monday. More than 450 grams of ivory was seized. According to the customs, a Xuzhou-based import and export corporation made a declaration on January 7 about 26 second-hand pianos imported from America. Customs guidelines require importers or exporters to declare the materials such products are made of, including ivory. However, when the company made the declaration, it said the pianos were made of wood and didn’t mention ivory. Officers knew there was a high possibility that some older makes of piano had ivory keys so they opened the container to check. They found eight pianos had ivory on their keys. The importer said it owned a piano teaching center and wanted to import some old pianos for display and performances.

Speaking to Angop on Monday, the director of the Institutional Communication and Press Office of the National Police Provincial Command, inspector José Chimuco, said that the foreigner hired a 47-year-old national, who took charge of transporting the six pieces of ivory in a Toyota vehicle, Hilux model, for 50,000 kwanzas. The killing of elephants in the Bicuar National Park, located in Huila, but which has neighbouring areas with the municipalities of Cahama and Xangongo (Cunene), has been a constant practice, and this month seven poachers were arrested, who admitted selling the ivory to Namibian citizens.

They were trying to sell the ivory on the Mysuru-Madikeri Highway. Acting on a tip-off, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) Forest Cell raided a location on the Highway near a burial ground at Chain Gate Madikeri and made the arrest. The arrested have been identified as Rafiq Ahmed Khan and Fazil Khan. The accused was looking for prospective buyers for the trophy and were moving in a suspicious manner with a bag containing the carved piece. The exact weight, length and the value of the piece in the international market have not been revealed yet and the accused are being interrogated about the source of the elephant tusk and the craftsmen who carved the ivory. The CID sleuths did not rule out a flourishing racket of ivory trade and said that a detailed investigation will be carried out. Normally plain tusks are traded and they get caught. “But here, a carved ivory has been seized and we have to gather information from the accused regarding the supply chain and how it reached Madikeri,” a source told Star of Mysore. The ivory will be sent for tests to ascertain its origin. According to Forest Department officials, the transaction of elephant tusks has been banned internationally as per CITES treaty. CITES stands for Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of wild fauna and flora. In total, 175 countries of the world are its members that bans trade of endangered species such as tigers, lions and their body parts. India became member of the treaty in the year 1976. A licence is required for possession of animal trophies including tusks. Not many people are aware of the existing laws and if someone is found with trophies without a valid licence of possession, they can be punished under Wildlife Prevention Act and also IPC. Tusks are one such item, an officer said.

 February 2nd, 2024 (Judgement): The accused, Hoang  Thi Diu, was today found not guilty of dealing in wildlife trophies by Principal Magistrate Gideon Kiage Oenga.  The verdict was not unexpected.
 
The judgement was read by Hon. Oenga. In summary, the he stated that:
• The prosecution evidence did not clarify if accused was either a tenant or landlord for her to have known contents in the house.
• There was no additional evidence to show knowledge of her being more than a short stay guest.
• That the accused had stayed for a very short period therefore could not qualify as a tenant or landlord.
• By the fact that the prosecution could not show the above, the accused could not be found dealing in wildlife trophies.
 
Court held that the accused was found not guilty and thereby acquitted under section 215 of the CPC.

International Policy Digest; 2024-02-2024
It could have been the proverbial pot of gold. Instead, it became at best, an opportunity lost in the fight against transnational organized wildlife crime. On February 2, a Nairobi area court acquitted Hoang Thi Diu, a female of apparent Vietnamese/Chinese dual citizenship, of charges relating to the dealing and possession of 145 kilograms of ivory, rhino horn, lion’s teeth, and claws.

Objectively, and considering the evidence before the court, the verdict was not incorrect. Evidence not presented, evidence that was contradictory, evidence not challenged, and evidence that was tainted, led the court to the only conclusion to be made.

It began with the sudden and unexpected death of 58-year-old Chinese national, Yang Chang Gui, in the early morning of November 16, 2022. Hoang Thi Diu, who had been given a spare bedroom for a temporary stay, became concerned when, in the early morning, Yang Chang Gui was not answering his continually ringing mobile phones. When she went to investigate, and with the assistance of the building caretaker, they discovered that Yang Chang Gui had seemingly passed away in his sleep.
The police were called to the spacious 3-bedroom apartment on the periphery of Nairobi’s Chinatown and in the process of what was surely expected to be a routine investigation, discovered under the bed of the deceased, three suitcases filled with cut-to-size elephant tusks.

Subsequently, the rest of the apartment was searched and more wildlife trophies and cutting tools were discovered. In the master bedroom was one suitcase with ten pieces of ivory, one piece of carry-on luggage with two rhino horns and two small ivory statues, six walkie-talkie-type devices, binoculars, and a large jar with a whitish liquid that was never identified. In the third bedroom, the bedroom of Hoang Thi Diu, a wrapped bag of lion’s teeth and claws was found. In other areas of the apartment, four hack saws and an electric saw.

On the face of it, the police had inadvertently come across a wildlife trophy consolidation point, a location where wildlife trophies were prepared for their export from Kenya and almost certainly through Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. Investigators had been presented with a serendipitous opportunity to crack an organized crime group’s wildlife trafficking pipeline in and out of Kenya.

By the time the investigation was complete, however, only Hoang Thi Diu, the short-term roommate who came across the deceased, had been charged. The subsequent trial testimony painted a picture that left more questions than answers, a common characteristic where transnational organized crime and the criminal justice systems go head-to-head. Invariably, in this part of the world, the criminal justice system is the also-ran.
The court was told that Yang Chang Gui had been living in Apartment C13, Sunshine Court, Lavington, for some years, but the number was never quantified. He died from causes never revealed to the court, and the presiding magistrate, Principal Magistrate Gideon Kiage of Kahawa Law Court, left to presume that his passing was not an obvious homicide.

The court was also informed that approximately 28 units of the 50-unit structure were owned by the South Sudanese government and not surprisingly, most of the residents of those apartments were from South Sudan. The deceased reportedly came into his particular apartment when the previous tenants had defaulted on their rent.
Courtroom testimony indicated that it was Yang Chang Gui’s older brother, now living in China, who had initially signed for the apartment and was presently paying the monthly rent; the deceased only paying for the electricity and water. There was never an indication as to whether Yang Chang Gui was gainfully employed and his immigration status in Kenya was never specified.

From an evidentiary perspective, the deceased’s bedroom was referred to as ‘Room 1,’ the room where 3 suitcases containing 70 pieces of ivory (or 68 pieces) were found. ‘Room 1,’ however, was not the master bedroom. The occupant of ‘Room 2,’ the master bedroom, was Ali Hussein, identified by the Investigating Officer, Chief Inspector Charles Inoti, as an Egyptian national. Chief Inspector Inoti was also, at the time, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations ‘Liaison Officer’ to the Kenya Wildlife Service and had been for at least 11 years. Inoti’s KWS team had at this point taken over the investigation from the police who were first on the scene.
Courtroom chitchat labelled Ali Hussein as a medical doctor but that was never confirmed. Testimony from the witnesses differed slightly, but it appeared that his room contained the rhino horn, two small ivory statues, six communication devices, binoculars, a large jar with a whitish liquid that was never identified, two safes, 2 to 3 passports, and possibly an air boarding pass.

Whether Ali Hussein lived in the apartment on a full-time or part-time basis was a question never definitively answered. Two of the prosecution witnesses, who were employees of the apartment complex, and the accused, testified that he was a close associate of the accused and lived there essentially on a full-time basis since at least 2021.

Inoti informed the court that after the initial seizure, an immigration alert had been put out for Ali Hussein and he was subsequently arrested at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport coming off an inbound flight. Hussein was arraigned at Kahawa court and in custody for a short period while an investigation was conducted. This included taking him back to the crime scene. Inoti told the court that the investigation cleared Hussein of any involvement in the criminal activity under investigation. He also said that the decision not to charge was made by prosecutors based on the fact that Ali Hussein was not at the scene at the time of the discovery.
The enigma surrounding the deceased and Ali Hussein was matched by that of Hoang Thi Diu. On her initial arrest, police announced that she was a Chinese national with a Chinese passport. Her charge sheet before the court indicated she is a Vietnamese national with a corresponding passport. She told the court in her defense that she had arrived in Kenya from Angola on August 29, 2022, looking for a sister who had run away with a boyfriend who had not been approved by the family. Inoti stated that her entry date was September 3.

She stayed initially at a 4-star hotel with a casino for about 10 days but found it too expensive ($100 per night). While searching for cheaper accommodation, she was introduced to the deceased at the hotel-casino, a casino she had also been led to believe was frequented by her runaway sister. The accused continued by telling the court that the deceased agreed for her to stay in his third bedroom until the permanent room occupant returned. She never touched any of the occupant’s possessions and never saw the ivory or rhino horn in the apartment while she was there. The court was not advised as to whether her sister had ever been located.
While Hoang Thi Dui’s version may have been saleable to someone who knew nothing of the case, it had been already muddied by the testimony of a previous witness. A Chinese national, living just outside Nairobi, testified that he had been contacted by the deceased’s brother to make the appropriate funeral arrangements and alluded to the court that the accused may have been working as an escort.

In addition, Hoang Thi Diu was seemingly provided a deference by the court during the entire court process. It began with her bail. Hoang Thi Diu, in Kenya from Angola, would surely have been a significant flight risk but was released on a cash bail of $1,300 with one passport being held by the court.
After her first lawyer withdrew from her case (Edwin Motari reportedly came by way of the Chinese community and had been previously arrested by masquerading as a lawyer), the court itself found a second lawyer to act on the accused’s behalf on a pro-bono basis. That arrangement fell through, and another pro-bono advocate was found.
Her trial was completed in 14 months, taking half the time typically seen for a similar matter. The court sat on 37 occasions to hear eight witnesses during that time. This trial also featured an atypical change in magistrates when Senior Resident Magistrate Boaz Ombewa went on leave and was replaced by Principal Magistrate Gideon Kiage. Far from being a humble single woman looking for a runaway sister, one could not be faulted for believing she was in Nairobi at the bidding of someone else, perhaps as an ‘escort’ and/or a wildlife trophy ‘mule.’

And what of the mobile phones of the deceased, the ones who according to the accused were ringing in the sitting room, alerting her to the fact that something was not right with the deceased? They were seized by police but did not make it to the inventory list submitted to the court. It only came out in cross-examination that a second inventory had been prepared for court purposes that omitted the seizure of three mobile phones and a printer. Chief Inspector Inoti later testified that the phones had been left off the ‘amended’ inventory as they were deemed not relevant to the matter before the court.

Could this not be a case where their irrelevance made them relevant, perhaps even exonerating the accused? And because the phones and printer were left off the inventory, the court was given no indication as to whom they were registered.

In September, in another Nairobi courtroom in another ivory trial, Senior Principle Magistrate S.O. Temu asked rhetorically to the same Chief Inspector Inoti, “You people go for small operators covering the people involved in these wildlife crimes. How do you want the courts to help in ending the trade, while the KWS don’t give us the big guys?”
Is this not a similar circumstance to the acquittal of Hoang Thu Diu and the exoneration of Ali Hussein? Stakeholders and the public are left to believe that Yang Chang Gui was solely responsible for the wildlife trophy collection point in Apartment C-13; that he kept wildlife trophies, communication devices, and cutting tools essentially all over an apartment shared with two other people, one who had been living there for some time.

Is it possible? Yes, it is possible. We have no idea as to the outcome of investigations completed; whether the working CCTV system of Sunshine Court was examined, whether the cleaner of Yang Chang Gui’s apartment C13 was interviewed, or whether the security agency responsible for the compound were consulted or their vehicle registry checked.

But is it likely? No. Is it believable? No, certainly not when all the facts are examined in concert.
We have a Nairobi apartment located on the periphery of Chinatown, being occupied by a Chinese male for several years with no visible financial means, living in an apartment owned by the South Sudanese government, with rent being paid by someone in China, found with 80 pieces of ivory in his apartment (or 78 pieces, police testimony differs), cut to size in suitcases, two rhino horn, 225 teeth and claws of leopard, lion, baboon and one piece of rhino skin, 6 walkie talkies, saws, a printer, checkbooks, two safes, company seals and stamps.

In addition, the original responding officer omitted to include in his written statement that he found, what were believed to be lion teeth and claws, in the bedroom of the accused, and that both Ali Hussein and Hoang Thi Diu had at least two passports each, that three mobile phones found in the apartment of the deceased were deemed irrelevant before the court, and that a second inventory provided to the court did not include these three phones or a printer also found in the apartment, and that the trial time was at least half of what is typical.

An opportunity lost or covered?

It is not yet known whether these elephants were killed in Mozambique on in a neighbouring country. Poachers now face lengthy prison sentences.

ALEXANDRIA, Va. (FOX 5 DC) - A Fredericksburg man pleaded guilty to the sale of elephant and whale ivory. According to court documents, Gary L. Cooper, 60, was using online storefronts from June 2015 to early 2020 to sell elephant and whale ivory, which was in violation of the Endangered Species Act. Officials say Cooper used Craigslist and eBay to sell individual carvings made from ivory. The items ranged in size, including two raw elephant tusks that measured at least 28 inches long. In addition to several raw and carved tusks, the advertisements offered numerous elephant ivory carvings and both raw and scrimshawed sperm whale teeth. Cooper told purchasers, including an undercover agent, that he was selling off an estate belonging to an elderly couple in poor health, when he was really buying ivory online and flipping the pieces. Officials say for about 16 months, beginning in September 2018, Cooper did business with United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) undercover agents by selling or offering about 50 pieces of elephant ivory, valued between $40,000 and $95,000. On November 17, 2018, Cooper offered to sell to an undercover USFWS Special Agent multiple ivory pieces for a total cost of $8,125. On November 26, 2018, he also sold two pieces of carved elephant ivory to the undercover agent and mailed the items from Virginia to New York. Forensics confirmed that it is genuine elephant ivory. Cooper is scheduled to be sentenced on August 31 and has turned over about 136 pieces of raw and carved ivory. He faces a maximum of one year in prison. This investigation was conducted by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Office of Law Enforcement, with assistance from the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources.

A Fredericksburg man pleaded guilty today to the unlawful sale of endangered species, including elephant and whale ivory. According to court documents, Gary L. Cooper, 60, operated online storefronts to sell elephant and whale ivory, all in violation of the Endangered Species Act. From at least June 2015 through early 2020, Cooper used online platforms, such as Craigslist and eBay, to list for sale individual carvings made in whole, or in part, from ivory. These items ranged in size, including two raw elephant tusks that measured at least 28 inches long. In addition to several raw and carved tusks, the advertisements offered numerous elephant ivory carvings and both raw and scrimshawed sperm whale teeth. Cooper told his clients, including an undercover agent, that he was selling off an estate belonging to an elderly couple in poor health, when in reality he was regularly buying ivory online and flipping the pieces for profit. Over about a sixteen-month period beginning in September 2018, Cooper did business with United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) undercover agents by selling or offering for sale no less than 50 pieces of elephant ivory, with a total market value between $40,000 and $95,000. During their correspondence, Cooper and the undercover agents discussed the illegality of buying and selling ivory across state lines. On November 17, 2018, Cooper offered to sell to an undercover USFWS Special Agent multiple ivory pieces for a total cost of $8,125. On November 26, 2018, Cooper sold two pieces of carved elephant ivory to the undercover agent and mailed the items from Virginia to New York. Upon forensic investigation, the items were confirmed to be genuine elephant ivory. Cooper is scheduled to be sentenced on August 31. As part of the plea, Cooper will forfeit approximately 136 pieces of raw and carved ivory. He faces a maximum penalty of 1 year in prison. Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. Raj Parekh, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, and Ryan Noel, Special Agent-in-Charge, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Office of Law Enforcement, made the announcement after U.S. Magistrate Judge John F. Anderson accepted the plea. This investigation was conducted by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Office of Law Enforcement, with assistance from the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources. Assistant U.S. Attorney Gordon Kromberg and Special Assistant U.S. Attorneys Alejandra Arias and Sara Hallmark are prosecuting the case.

THREE Harare men appeared in court charged with illegal possession of ivory after they were caught with 37kgs of elephant tasks. The three are Bhekithemba Mathe (30), Thando Mpala (26) and Talent Ganya (30). They appeared before Harare Magistrate, Yeukai Dzuda, who advised them to seek bail at the High Court. They will be back in court on May 20, 2022. It is the state’s case that on May 4, 2022, detectives received a tipoff that the three were in possession of ivory and looking for buyers. Two of the detectives were given contact details of Ganya, whom they contacted pretending to be buyers and they agreed to meet. The detectives met Ganya, who led them to Warren Park 1, while other detectives followed behind unnoticed. When they arrived in Warren Park 1, Ganya contacted his accomplices. They reached an agreement to sell the ivory for US$80/kg. The detectives were instructed to drive and park on Westwood Street for easy transportation, since they claimed that the ivory was heavy. Mpala and Mathe then allegedly went to their place of residence and came back driving a silver Toyota Spacio with the ivory in the boot. The detectives were called to weigh the ivory and while they were still in the process of doing so, a backup team pounced on the unsuspecting trio. They introduced themselves to the trio by producing their police identity cards and asked the trio to produce a license authorizing them to be in possession of ivory, which they failed to do, leading to their arrest. Further investigations revealed that Mpala had brought the from Bulawayo having been given by one Mthulisi Moyo who is still at large. Faith Mavhudzi represented the state.

Ivory, in addition to being a constituent element of works of art that can cost tens of thousands of euros, is subject to the protection of CITES, the Washington Convention which regulates international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora. of extinction whose sale without the prescribed CITES documentation constitutes a hypothesis of crime. The European Union already has strict regulations on the ivory trade and is committed to taking further action against elephant poaching and ivory trafficking worldwide. To ensure that the ivory trade in the EU does not contribute to these threats, the EU further tightened its ivory trade rules in December 2021, including a CITES certificate requirement for trade in all ivory items. also for objects prior to 1947 that could be marketed with a simple appraisal or documentation that certifies their qualification as an ancient pre-47 object. The illegal trafficking of the so-called ""white gold"" is currently an important ""business"" linked to the phenomenon of poachers who, without scruples, kill a considerable number of elephants every year, dangerously bringing the species to the threshold of extinction risk. Despite the international ban on the ivory trade, elephant poaching and ivory trafficking are still a relevant phenomenon. CITES entered into force in Italy in 1980 and is currently applied by 183 states. The Washington Convention represents today one of the most important international regulatory instruments to guarantee the conservation of our planet's biodiversity, making the trade of over 35,000 protected species sustainable. A priority task for each State is in fact to monitor and regulate the national and international trade of specimens and products derived from animal and plant species in order to prevent their extinction, in a situation that is already seriously unfavorable due to the negative effects caused by multiple human activities. and climate change that is destroying the natural habitats of numerous species.

On June 16th, 2022, at 07:30, Kenya customs authorities during X-ray scanning, discovered what was reported to be an ivory statue in the luggage of an inbound passenger. Sixty-eight-year-old Italian national, Paolo Brondi, was subsequently arrested.  He initially appeared in a Mombasa court on June 20th before Principle Magistrate Martin Rabera and pled guilty to all charges relating to the .6 kg ivory statue that was found in his luggage.  As there was no Italian interpreter in court, Magistrate Rabera adjourned the case to June 22nd and so ordering an interpreter to attend. He was not comfortable that Brondi had a full appreciation to the seriousness of the charges he was facing. On June 22nd, with an interpreter in court, Paulo Brondi pled not guilty to four charges; possession of wildlife trophy, manufacturing an item from a specified endangered trophy, importing a wildlife trophy into the country and bringing into a customs area prohibited goods, the last charge under the East Africa Community Customs Act. Magistrate Rabera has remanded Brondi until July 1st pending a probation report for the purposes of bond decision. It is reported that he is a regular but part time resident of Watamu.

He is certainly not a poacher, nor an international smuggler of valuables, and even less of a thug. But Paolo Brondi, a Piedmontese who travels back and forth from Italy to Watamu, where he would plan to settle a few months a year, now faces a very heavy penalty for possession of an ivory figurine weighing about six hundred grams. Brondi, who is well known among the Italians stationed in Watamu and considered a decent person who has found like many in Kenya a place to relax and enjoy a prolonged vacation, was stopped a few days ago upon arrival at Mombasa's MOI International Airport with the valuable ivory necklace and, after being detained by local authorities, admitted that he was its owner and that he had brought it especially from Italy but that since it was a worked object (with a sculpture depicting himself, as reported by the TV channel K24 news site with an estimated value of 17 thousand euros) he did not think it was a crime. In fact, Kenya punishes the possession and trafficking of ivory, both with regard to elephant tusks or pieces of them, and with regard to worked and semi-processed items that are not properly reported and have certificates attesting to their age and provenance. Already in the past, there have been cases of seizures and fines for those who failed to report historical hunting trophies or other wildlife relics (including ivory), and the Kenya Wildlife Service had issued an ultimatum to all owners of objects or parts of land or sea animal species that it is illegal to capture and possess (except precisely for ancient objects duly reported in times of no suspicion). Now Brondi, who has already appeared a first time before Mombasa Judge Martin Rabera and pleaded guilty to the charge of possessing a trophy wildlife of endangered species, contrary to Section 92 (4) of the Wildlife Conservation and Management Act, will have to appear in court hearings in Mombasa to explain exactly how and where he got that ivory in the hope that Kenyan authorities will understand his good faith and his terrible naiveté that led him to ignore not only Kenyan but international laws. Because the penalties for detaining and trafficking ivory can carry up to 20 years in prison.

The Lilongwe Senior Resident Magistrate’s Court yesterday [23/05/2022] sentenced 61-year-old Maliko Mndekano Mwale to 10 years imprisonment with hard labour for illegal possession of ivory. Mwale was found guilty of possession and dealing in government trophy contrary to Section 86 of the National Parks and Wildlife Act of 2017. Public Relations Officer for Lingazi Police Station Sub Inspector Salomy Zgambo has confirmed the conviction of Maliko Mndekano Mwale. Sub-Inspector Zgambo said that the court through state prosecutor Assistant Superintendent Daveson Banda heard that the accused person on April 20 [2022], 2022 was offering for sale raw ivory at K80, 000 per kilogram. She said that State Prosecutor Assistant Superintendent Banda further told the court that as professionals, police posed as potential buyers and managed to arrest the suspect at City Centre Area 13 near mosque. Appearing before court, Maliko was convicted on his own plea of guilty of illegal possession of and dealing in government trophy. In his submission, state prosecutor Assistant Superintendent Banda pleaded with the court for a stiff punishment to deter other would-be offenders. In mitigation, Maliko pleaded with the court for leniency, saying he has a family which sorely depend on him. He also asked the court to consider his age. But passing judgement, Senior Resident Magistrate James Mankhwazi said wildlife cases where animals are being killed are increasing despite government’s warnings about the same. He said wildlife is part of tourism hence slapped the convict with 10 years imprisonment with hard labour. Maliko Mndekano Mwale hails from Mlekano Village in Traditional Authority Kayembe in Dowa District.

Borneo Today; 2020-10-01
TAWAU: Sepasang suami isteri masing-masing didenda sebanyak RM100,000 dan penjara empat tahun selepas mengaku bersalah atas pertuduhan memiliki empat batang gading gajah Borneo secara haram, di Mahkamah Sesyen, di sini hari ini.
Tertuduh Hendrikus Pale, 48, dan isterinya Anastasia Daton, 50, didakwa melakukan kesalahan itu pada 5 Januari lalu, pukul 1.30 petang di rumah pekerja Ladang Maliau Serijaya Industries Sdn Bhd dalam kawasan Hutan Simpan Gunung Rara (kelas II), dalam daerah Kalabakan-Tawau.
Berdasarkan pertuduhan yang dibacakan dihadapan Hakim Awang Kerisnada Awang Mahmud, kedua-dua tertuduh didakwa dengan niat telah memiliki atau bersubahat memiliki gading gajah berkenaan iaitu suatu hasil daripada spesis haiwan yang dilindungi sepenuhnya seperti mana disenaraikan dalam Bahagian 1, Jadual 1, Nombor 11 Enakmen Pemeliharaan Hidupan Liar 1997 tanpa kebenaran bertulis dari menteri yang bertindak atas nasihat pengarah.
Sehubungan itu, tertuduh didakwa melakukan kesalahan mengikut Seksyen 41 (1) Enakmen Pemeliharaan Hidupan Liar 1997 dan boleh dihukum dibawah Seksyen 41(1)(a) Enakmen yang sama dibacakan bersama Seksyen 34 Kanun Keseksaan.
Jika sabit kesalahan, tertuduh boleh dikenakan hukuman denda antara RM50,000 hingga RM250,000 dan penjara antara satu hingga lima tahun.
Pendakwaan dilakukan Pegawai Pendakwa Jabatan Hidupan Liar (JHL) Abdul Karim Dakog manakala tertuduh tidak diwakili peguam.
Terdahulu, kedua-dua tertuduh merayu mahkamah agar meringankan hukuman memandangkan mereka perlu menyara anak yang kini berada di kampung, Indonesia.
Abdul Karim dalam hujahnya berkata, pemilikan empat gading itu memerlukan sekurang-kurangnya dua ekor gajah Borneo mati dibunuh.
Malah menurutnya, gajah Borneo adalah haiwan yang dilindungi dan menjadi satu kesalahan besar jika memiliki gading tanpa kebenaran di negeri ini
Awang Kerisnada berkata, mahkamah tidak boleh mengenakan hukuman yang ringan bagi kesalahan tersebut kerana mengambil kira kes, kepupusan haiwan dan kepentingan awam.
“Gajah Borneo adalah spesis dilindungi dan hampir pupus. Justeru, saya mahukan hukuman yang dikenakan ini memberi mesej yang cukup jelas kepada orang ramai betapa seriusnya kesalahan ini sekali gus tidak melakukannya.
“Apatah lagi, tertuduh adalah warga asing yang bekerja di sini, sanggup melanggar perundangan negara ini,” katanya.
Beliau menjelaskan, aktiviti membunuh gajah Borneo yang semakin meningkat di Sabah berlaku disebabkan adanya mereka (tertuduh) sebagai pembeli dan mengambil untung daripada hasil jualan semula gading tersebut.
“Sehubungan itu, mahkamah memutuskan setiap tertuduh dikenakan hukuman denda sebanyak RM100,000 dan penjara 4 tahun bermula hari ini.
“Selain itu, jika gagal membayar denda, mereka akan dipenjara selama setahun dan hukuman itu dijalankan secara berasingan dengan hukuman penjara sedia ada,” katanya.
Awang Kerisnada berkata, kedua-dua tertuduh juga hendaklah diserahkan kepada Jabatan Imigresen Malaysia (JIM) untuk tujuan pengusiran selepas tamat menjalani hukuman penjara, selain semua gading yang dirampas diserahkan kepada JHL bagi tujuan perlupusan mengikut perundangan.
Sementara itu, sebaik selesai prosiding mahkamah, Hendrikus kelihatan sebak dan mula sedikit hilang pertimbangan dipercayai akibat tidak berpuas hati dengan hukuman tersebut.
Kekecohan berlaku apabila Hendrikus mula bertindak agresif dan menjerit ke arah pegawai JHL yang mengawalnya.
Pihak polis dan pegawai JHL terpaksa mengambil masa hampir 10 minit untuk menenangkan tertuduh sebelum dia dan isterinya dibawa keluar dari pekarangan mahkamah ke penjara untuk menjalani hukuman.

Loose English translation
TAWAU: A husband and wife were each fined RM100,000 and jailed for four years after pleading guilty to the charge of illegally possessing four Borneo elephant tusks, at the Sessions Court, here today.
Accused Hendrikus Pale, 48, and his wife Anastasia Daton, 50, were charged with committing the offense on January 5, at 1.30pm at the home of Ladang Maliau Serijaya Industries Sdn Bhd workers in the Gunung Rara Forest Reserve (class II), in the Kalabakan-Tawau district. .

Based on the charges that were read before Judge Awang Kerisnada Awang Mahmud, the two accused were charged with the intention of possessing or conspiring to possess the elephant tusks in question, which is a product of a fully protected animal species as listed in Part 1, Table 1, Number 11 of the Wildlife Conservation Enactment Wild 1997 without the written permission of the minister acting on the advice of the director.
Accordingly, the accused is charged with committing an offense under Section 41 (1) of the Wildlife Conservation Enactment 1997 and can be punished under Section 41(1)(a) of the same Enactment read with Section 34 of the Penal Code.

If convicted, the accused can be fined between RM50,000 and RM250,000 and imprisoned between one and five years.
The prosecution was carried out by the Prosecuting Officer of the Wildlife Department (JHL) Abdul Karim Dakog while the accused was not represented by a lawyer.
Earlier, the two accused appealed to the court to lighten the sentence considering that they have to support their children who are now in the village, Indonesia.
Abdul Karim in his argument said that the ownership of the four tusks required at least two Borneo elephants to be killed.
In fact, according to him, Borneo elephants are protected animals and it is a big offense to have tusks without permission in this state
Awang Kerisnada said, the court cannot impose a light sentence for the offense because it takes into account the case, the extinction of animals and the public interest.
""The Borneo elephant is a protected species and is on the verge of extinction. Therefore, I want the punishment imposed to give a clear enough message to the public how serious this offense is so as not to do it.

""What's more, the accused is a foreigner working here, willing to violate the laws of this country,"" he said.
He explained that the increasing killing of Borneo elephants in Sabah is due to them (the accused) being buyers and profiting from the resale of the tusks.
""Accordingly, the court ruled that each accused be fined RM100,000 and imprisoned for 4 years starting today.
""In addition, if they fail to pay the fine, they will be imprisoned for a year and the sentence will be carried out separately from the existing prison sentence,"" he said.
Awang Kerisnada said the two accused should also be handed over to the Malaysian Immigration Department (JIM) for the purpose of deportation after serving their prison sentences, in addition to all confiscated ivory being handed over to JHL for disposal in accordance with the law.
Meanwhile, as soon as the court proceedings were over, Hendrikus looked tearful and began to lose his judgment a little, believed to be due to his dissatisfaction with the sentence.

A commotion broke out when Hendrikus started acting aggressively and yelling at the JHL officers who were guarding him.
The police and JHL officers had to take nearly 10 minutes to calm the accused before he and his wife were taken out of the court yard to prison to serve their sentence.

The Indonesian police have arrested two alleged killers of protected Sumatran elephants and been hunting another person for alleged involvement in the case. The suspects sold the tusks and other body parts of the elephants (elephas maximus sumatranus) they hunted in Riau province, the Indragiri Hulu District, Police's Chief Efrizal SIK said on Monday. The two persons were captured in the province and nearby North Sumatra province last month with scores of evidence including the skulls of elephants, a pair of tusks and assembled weapons, said the police officer. The two persons have long been implicated in poaching of endangered giant mammals, he said. They were involved in the killing of Sumatran elephants in the districts of Palalawan and Bengkalis in Riau province in 2015, said Efrizal. Under the law, the suspects shall face a five-year jail term and pay fines if found guilty, local media reported. The Sumatran elephant is a sub-species of Asian elephant which is extremely rare. The number of the Sumatran elephants just reached around 2,000 based on the prediction in 2000. The animals are found exclusively in the Sumatra Island, but their population has severely drifted down as they lost more than 80 percent of habitat due to deforestation.

These individuals were apprehended with a travel bag in which they had hidden the ivories and organs they had removed. While waiting to be presented before the prosecutor, the two suspects are facing up to 10 years in prison for complicity in the possession and attempted sale of ivory.

Rwanda Investigation Bureau (RIB) has in custody four people held for allegedly trafficking products from endangered animals such as elephant ivory. They were caught while using Rwanda as a transit country to smuggle 45 kilogrammes of ivory from the Democratic Republic of Congo to Asian countries, according to RIB Spokesperson Thierry
Murangira. The illicit merchandise was transported in a Toyota double cabin which had diplomatic number plates. The destination countries were not specified. The suspects include two Rwandans – one of them working with a regional body which earned him diplomatic status – one Burundian and a Congolese national. Desire Murokozi, who is the head of finance at the regional power development firm SINELAC, and Derrick Gisa, are the two Rwandans while Cyriaque Kaburaburyo, is the Burundian national, and
Nicodem Bagabo, Congolese. The quartet however does not agree on the account of the events. According to one version, a one Gideon Imanishimwe who is the alleged ‘boss’ and remains at large, got in contact with Murokozi and interested him in the deal. The deal was to transport ivory from DR Congo and transit through Rwanda to the Asian market. According to Kaburaburyo and Bagabo, the 45 kgs were given as a sample to Imanishimwe who had earlier requested for a larger consignment. They were intercepted on their way to Kigali from DR Congo via the Rusizi border. The Burundian national claims to have put in touch the ivory owner based in DR Congo with Murokozi, but claims he was not part of the negotiations and only accompanied the latter because he was his boss. On the other hand, Bagabo said he travelled to Kigali to get the payment from Imanishimwe, which he would then take back to the ivory owner in DR Congo. However, Murokozi denies knowing anything about it, saying he only offered the trio a lift in his car from Rusizi to Kigali. ""I had no idea what was in their bags, and I was not involved in their business,"" he explained. According to Murangira, the four were arrested last week on Friday and they were still looking for their collaborators, including Imanishimwe. ""Any individual who hunts sells, injures, or kills a protected animal species or its products commits an offense,"" Murangira declared, citing Rwandan Law on Environment N°48/2018 in its article 58. ""It is not only a crime in Rwanda, but it is also a violation of the international treaty on the protection of endangered species,"" he continued, adding that Rwanda should not be used a transit of illicit merchandise. Murangira said that the four are detained at Kicukiro RIB station pending conclusion of investigations, after which they will be handed over to prosecution. Upon conviction, they risk a sentence of not less than five years and not more than seven years in prison, as well as a fine of between Rwf5 million and 7 million.

Major Nguyen The Anh, an officer of the Environmental Crime Prevention and Control Department, shared: “When we went to the inspection, many establishment owners declared most of their first violations. Faced with a fine of 180 million VND for less than 300g of ivory, many people are surprised because they have not had enough money to pay the fine in their whole life.

He commended officials from Tarangire, Burunge Wildlife Management Area (WMA) and Chemchem Association for the job well done. He named the suspects as Benard Masalu and Yembeson Masumbuko. “The suspects are currently in police custody and investigation is ongoing will later appear in court to face charges,” Mbanjoko said. He said that the anti-poaching operation is endless thus warned those engaging in the illegal activity to stop doing so as the government will not spare anyone once caught. He also warned public leaders who have been entertaining poaching in their areas by colluding with poachers to stop doing so as stern measures will be taken against them. Chief executive officer of Chemchem Association, Walter Pallangayo said that arrest of the suspects has been assisted with the intelligence information which the task force had received. “After receiving the information, we planned and set up a trap. Some of us pretended to be buyers and then the suspects later agreed to sell the trophies at a cost of 3.5m/- [ 1,502.80 USD as of 03/02/2021], this made the job easier to arrest them,” he said. The Chemchem association which has invested in tourist hotels and photo tourism in the Burunge WMA has a special anti-poaching Fund for 400m/-  [171,749 as of 03/02/2021]] per year for its operations. The Fund works closely with the WMA militias, KDU in the northern zone and Tarangire National Park paramilitaries and the Chemichem security force.

The top forest officer also informed that so far, two persons have been arrested from Dadgiri and Daimuguri-Laimuti in Chirang district on charges of illegally possessing elephant tusks. He said, “A total of 17 kg of elephants tusks have been recovered from the possession of the two arrested persons.” The DFO informed that the market value of all the tusks, recovered from different locations in Chirang district, will be around Rs 10 lakh. The forest officials with the help of Chirang police on Sunday nabbed one elephant tusk smuggler, identified as Alen Basumatary and recovered two tusks from his possession. DFO Patiri said the elephant tusk smugglers sell the tusks in China and Myanmar through Nepal. Sources said, the tusks were collected by the smugglers after killing the animals in Manas and Ultapani forests. “Due to lockdown, the smugglers failed to sell the tusks in the illegal market,” sources added. The forest official sources said it is expected that more elephant tusk smugglers will land in the forest department’s net soon.

They were caught red-handed by a mixed team composed of elements of Park W, those of the forest inspection, the Republican police of Kandi with the technical collaboration of the Support Program for the Application of Laws on Fauna and Flora in Benin (AALF-Benin). According to concordant sources, this arrest, which took place in the early hours of Friday, September 27, 2019, once again blocks the road to individuals who threaten the wildlife heritage of the sub-region, and confirms the willingness of the Government of Benin to put out of action the enemies of wildlife. These four seized spikes are synonymous with two slaughtered elephants. However, the elephant is a fully protected species and no one has the right to hold, circulate and market its trophies. Under Law 2002-16 of 18 October 2004, these alleged traffickers as soon as justice proves their guilt, will pay a fine of 100,000F to 500,000F and/or be imprisoned for 3 months to 3 years. Activists have always wanted there to be ""Zero Tolerance"" for environmental crimes. It is undoubtedly the choice of rupture that attaches value to fully protected species such as the elephant, which is one of the five most sought-after wild animals in a park. Rigorous enforcement of environmental laws is therefore needed to discourage traffickers and enhance the natural resources of protected areas. It is strongly hoped that the Ministry of Living Environment and Sustainable Development and its structures under supervision will make a particular follow-up for this case so that these three alleged traffickers are severely punished.

The accused were Debendranath Mahali, Jagannath Sigh, Pankaj Kumar Mahali, Binu Singh from Uparataladiha village and Sushant Singh of Jamudiha village under the Udala police station. Honorary Wildlife Warden Bhanumitra Acharya said the seized tusks date back to one to two years. “As a tusker carcass has not been seized in past one or two years, it is suspected that poachers might have killed the elephant in the Similipal core area or hid its carcass somewhere to extract the tusks,” he added.

The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) seized elephants’ tusks worth more than Rs 10 crore and arrested two residents of Assam on Saturday afternoon. The duo, sources said, were carrying the tusks from Assam to Uttar Pradesh and had allegedly planned to smuggle the same into Nepal. Tusks weighing 7.320 kilos, the cost of which is around Rs 10 crore, were found in the possession of Suleman Khan and Ratan Goala, both residents of Hojai district in Assam. “They were arrested under the Customs Act, 1962, and produced in the additional chief judicial magistrate’s court in Siliguri today (Sunday). The court remanded them in judicial custody for one day and will be produced in court again tomorrow,” DRI’s lawyer Ratan Banik said. Sources said the DRI had received a tip-off that ivory would be illegally transported through Siliguri by train. A DRI team reached New Jalpaiguri station and raided the New Delhi-bound Rajdhani Express that had arrived from the Northeast. Khan and Goala were apprehended and taken to the office of the DRI here with their baggage. “We searched their luggage and found the tusks,” said a source. In total, there were three ivory pieces, one in conical and two in cylindrical shapes. They were covered with thick adhesive tapes and kept in a bag. DRI officials called representatives of the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau for the verification of elephant tusks. They checked the objects and confirmed that the seized articles were the tusks of the Asiatic elephant, which is a schedule-I animal, protected under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.

Two exquisite gem-studded bracelets made of elephant tusks were seized in Madikeri yesterday by the CID Forest Unit Police and one person has been arrested. The accused was trying to sell the jewellery in the town. Based on definite information, the CID sleuths raided a bus shelter near Sudarshan Circle on the Madikeri-Siddapur Road and arrested 47-year-old P. Pradeep Kumar, a resident of Kollegal. The huge tusks have been cut into small pieces and shaped like bracelets with colourful gemstones attached to metal hinges. The sleuths posed as potential buyers and raided the place. Sub-Inspector C.U. Savi, staff Shekar, Rajesh, Raghavendra, Yogesh, Umesh, Swamy and Manjunath were part of the raiding team. Sources said that the ivory items will be sent to the laboratory for forensic examination and DNA testing, which would help establish its genuineness and origin. “In some cases, smugglers showed genuine ivory jewellery to fool people and later sold fakes. It looks like they have collected them from others. There is no elephant poaching angle for now, but we are digging into the case,” officers said.

Customs officials have seized two ivory items weighing about 35 grams in total from an imported package in Changsha, the capital of Central China's Hunan province. Officials found the ivory products concealed in a package, and further inspection revealed that these items were an ivory necklace and an ivory pendant, according to the customs of Changsha. The Chinese government suspended imports of ivory and ivory products in 2015 and ended related commercial processing and sales at the end of 2017 as part of its commitment to protecting wild animals. The country has also seen a significant decline in ivory smuggling cases amid an intensified crackdown on such crimes. The total volume of seized ivory products plunged to 68 kg in 2021 from 9.2 tonnes in 2019, according to the General Administration of Customs.

Customs officers seized several dozen illegal ivory jewelry pieces from a German citizen worth up to $13,000 per pound on the black market. Officers from the city of Dresden in Germany confiscated about 60 pieces of illegal ivory jewelry from a man at the Leipzig airport. The man remains unnamed, but the police reported he is 28 years old and tried to smuggle six prayer chains and 54 ivory chain links on June 9 [2021]. But this is not the first time Dresden officers have had trouble with this individual. German officers seized seven mailed items including 20 chains, two rings, and an ivory walking stick at the end of 2020. The illegal jewelry items in the package sent from Egypt and addressed to the man added up to nearly 4 pounds (1.8 kilograms). After officers confiscated the items in June, the man was accused of illegally importing elephant ivory products into Germany and reselling them for profit without possessing an appropriate species protection permit. Ongoing investigations by the Leipzig Public Prosecutor’s Office and the Dresden Customs Bureau might take some time to complete, the police said. If found guilty, the man faces a prison sentence of up to five years. https://tntribune.com/tusk-force-customs-team-seizes-more-than-60-pieces-of-cruel-ivory-jewelry/

On 9 June 2021, Dresden customs investigators searched the residential and business premises of a 28-year-old man from Leipzig and seized six prayer beads and 54 individual ivory chain links. Already at the end of last year, control forces of the main customs office Dresden at Leipzig/Halle Airport withdrew seven postal items coming from Egypt and addressed to the man from circulation. In addition to various jewelry items, these contained a total of 20 chains, two rings and a walking stick made of ivory with a total weight of over 1,800 grams. The customs investigation office Dresden, under the direction of the public prosecutor's office in Leipzig, then took over the further investigation and finally searched the premises of the recipient on 9 June 2021. He is accused of illegally importing ivory products from elephants into Germany and then reselling them profitably without being in possession of a corresponding species protection permit. The investigations of the public prosecutor's office in Leipzig and the customs office in Dresden are ongoing and will take some time.

The illegal item, which the German customs officials said was “tasteless” and lacking the proper paperwork, had been posted from the U.K. to Germany and was reportedly intended as a “gift”, to be picked up by an unnamed Swiss person in Weil am Rhein, which is a town in south-western Germany, in Baden-Wuerttemberg, where the French, German and Swiss borders meet. Weil am Rhein is located right on the German border with Switzerland, just 1.24 miles from it. But the customs officers in Germany discovered the item in the post and launched an investigation after determining that it was a genuine African elephant’s foot. The customs officials said that the elephant foot, from a “highly endangered” and protected species, had been converted into some sort of container or box. The Main Customs Office in the town of Loerrach, which is also located in the south-western German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, a few miles down the road from Weil am Rhein, said in a statement released on Thursday, August 18 and obtained by Zenger News: “At the beginning of February this year, officials at the Weil am Rhein customs office seized a real elephant’s foot, which had been converted into a container, in a postal item.” The customs officials added that the package had been posted from England and was intended for a Swiss person who had had it shipped to a German pick-up address. They said: “The package was posted in England and was intended for a recipient in Switzerland who had had the shipment delivered to a German pick-up address. “The customs clearance was therefore carried out at the customs office in Weil am Rhein.” The customs officials explained that African elephants (Loxodonta) are a protected species, adding: “The appraisal by an expert showed that it was the foot of an African elephant. According to the Federal Nature Conservation Act, elephants are an animal species that is particularly strictly protected and is still highly endangered due to the hunt for ivory, the marketing of which is prohibited in principle.” They called the item “tasteless” and said that the recipient did not have the necessary paperwork to import such an item. They said: “The recipient was unable to present the documents required for importing the tasteless gift.” Maya Jehle, of the customs office in Loerrach, said: “The foot was completely hollowed out from the inside and damaged on top with a red velvet cover and golden fringes. It’s totally tasteless.” Officials at the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation in Bonn are now handling the investigation, which is ongoing.

On January 9, five men were arrested in Ntulele, Narok county, while ferrying 32.9 kilos of elephant tusks worth about Sh3 million. The five had concealed six pieces of the tusks in a sack of charcoal. They were using two motorcycles to transport the tusks when they were stopped by Kenya Wildlife Service personnel and police. Police said the men were under interrogation after an initial appearance in court to reveal the source of the tusks. But it seems they had killed at least three elephants to get the tusks, which they said were to be delivered in Nairobi. Police said they expected more arrests in the probe. “The trade in tusks is illegal and everyone should know this. We will investigate further to get all players involved,” police spokesperson Dr Resla Onyango said.

A large number of wildlife products, such as animal skins and taxidermy, were seized in raids carried out in clandestine workshops in San Justo and Florencio Varela. Two people were arrested during the proceedings. Authorities believe that these places hide behind a network of poachers and trafficking of animals of protected species. Among the seized material were heads and skins of deer and antelope of different species, African lion, tirica cat, pumas and African elephant hides. In addition, in one of the raided workshops they found a hippopotamus in the process of tanning. Some pieces were found taxidermied and others frozen, ready to be subjected to this process. The seized material was taken for safekeeping to the Bernardino Rivadavia Museum of Natural Sciences by order of the intervening court, within the framework of the case for violation of the Wildlife Conservation Law. As a result of the operations, two people were arrested, who were charged with not having all the documentation that supports the legitimate possession of the pieces. The procedures, carried out by members of the Environmental Control Brigade (BCA), under the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, are part of the actions that the ministry led by Juan Cabandié carries out against the illegal trade of wildlife. The raid was ordered by the Federal Court of Quilmes and carried out by the BCA in conjunction with the Environmental Crimes Department of the Argentine Federal Police.

The four poachers were arrested following a raid by a joint team of Bisoi police and Similipal Tiger Reserve (STR) at three places including Rugudidiha and Matiali sahi areas last night. Over 50 personnel were involved in the operation. All the accused were nabbed after the joint team got information that the poachers were planning to strike a deal for the tusks. One of the accused had kept the ivory hidden at an isolated place behind the backyard of his house. Sources said that a detailed investigation will be carried out to ascertain involvement of the poachers in other wildlife crimes. Further, their linkages with other gang involved in illegal wildlife trade will also be ascertained. It is pertinent to mention here that the decomposed carcass of the elephant with its tusks missing was recovered from Talabandha wildlife range of Similipal Tiger Reserve (STR) on January 21. Earlier, several forest department officials of Jenabil range under STR south were arrested on the charges of destroying evidence by burning the carcass of an elephant under Gurandi beat in December 2022.

Dutch law officials seized several elephant tusks worth tens of thousands of euros in a probe into illegal ivory smuggling, police said on Thursday. In their latest haul, police and customs officers intercepted 85 kilogrammes (187 pounds) of ivory, valued at around 50,000 euros ($52,000) in the port city of Rotterdam. “We are suspecting illegal organised trading in ivory,” police said, after opening a probe earlier this year. The investigation was triggered when a postal company noted a large and suspicious package containing a wooden crate.  Inside, police found a single tusk — which had been sent for forensic analysis. Other subsequent shipments have been intercepted, police said.  They did not say where the tusks were coming from or going to but added environmental agents from a police team dealing with Indonesia was participating in the investigation.

In an international investigation into the ivory trade, the police have seized several elephant tusks. The more than 85 kilos of ivory has a value of more than 50,000 euros, reports the police. The investigation started a few months ago, when a postal company in the Rotterdam area received a package that looked suspicious. It was a large wooden box. When it was opened, they found a large elephant tusk. The trade in raw ivory is prohibited in Europe and therefore the find was reported to customs. Customs had the tusk examined in a laboratory. Research was done on the origin of the ivory and the age determined. Customs then called in team Milieu Rotterdam, after which an investigation was started under the direction of a public prosecutor. The aim of the research is to map out exactly which way the ivory travels and which persons and companies are involved in this trade. ""It is suspected that there is structural trade in ivory. Several shipments have already been intercepted,"" writes the police. The police did not disclose how many shipments are involved. The research will continue in the coming period. Arrests are not excluded.

It was during a punch operation, carried out by agents of the regional delegation of Forests and Wildlife of the Center, in collaboration with the regional division of the Judicial Police, that the two alleged traffickers were arrested in Yaounde. The two traffickers were apprehended in downtown Yaoundé while trying to sell elephant tusks. They were found with two whole tusks and 12 huge pieces of ivory hidden among clothing in a suitcase. The elephant tusks weighed nearly 60 kg. The suspects were remanded to Yaoundé-Kondengui central prison. A Wildlife Law Enforcement Support Organization (LAGA), provided technical assistance during this operation. According to a source who wished to remain anonymous, the two suspects belong to a vast network of traffickers which extends in the sub-region and as far as Nigeria. They specialize in the trafficking of many wildlife species, including elephant tusks and feline skins. The source also added that the elephant tusks come from Congo and the network uses heavy-duty storage crates to transport these wildlife products from one country to another. Under the Wildlife Act 1994, anyone found at any time and anywhere, in possession of all or part of a protected species, is deemed to have killed the animal. Strict enforcement of this law is therefore necessary to stem the extinction of elephants in the country and in the region. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the elephant population, particularly the African forest elephant, is in steep decline due to poaching. Ofir Drori, founding director of the Eco Activists for Governance and Law Enforcement (EAGLE Network) said the poaching situation in the sub-region is serious, especially in northern Congo and south-eastern Cameroon. This iconic animal faces a serious threat, due to its ivory, and is on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. Elephants play a very important role in our ecosystem and many environmental scientists say urgent action is needed, as IUCN Director General Dr Bruno Oberle said: “We urgently need to put an end to poaching and ensure that we conserve adequate habitat, sufficient for forest and savannah elephants. Several African countries have shown the way in recent years, proving that we can reverse the decline of elephants, and we must work together so that their example can be followed.""

2 traffickers arrested with 10 elephant tusks weighing 56 kg. They concealed the tusks in a suitcase and transported it on a motorcycle to a residence where they were expected to carry out the transaction. Soon after they arrived, the arresting team moved in and apprehended them. The contraband was concealed in Briqueterie, a notorious neighbourhood in Yaounde known for wildlife trafficking and other dangerous criminal activities. The traffickers belong to a trafficking ring operating in major ivory trafficking hotspots in the country and especially in a town close to the border with Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. The traffickers are linked to Abdoul Salami, arrested in 2021 with 2 tons of pangolin scales and leopard skins. The ring operates in Congo, Gabon, Nigeria and beyond. Close relatives attempted to free the traffickers by applying pressure on wildlife officials but the attempts were combated.

A Kirinyaga county employee was among six suspects arraigned before a Gichugu law court on Wednesday after being caught in possession of elephant tusks. Samuel Murimi together with Patrick Njogu,Christopher Gatimu, James Mwangi, Peter Mwendia and Eliud Kinyua denied the charges. The suspects were charged with dealing in wildlife trophies contrary to the Wildlife Conservation Management Act. They were charged that on January 19, 2023, within Kimunye shopping centre in Gichugu, they were arrested while ferrying two elephant tusks in a Prado at 1 pm. The 4.5 kg wildlife trophies that were nabbed from the suspects are worth a street value of Sh2.95 million. The accused through their lawyers pleaded to be released on bond or bail citing that they remain innocent until proven guilty. However, their prayers were vehemently objected to by the prosecution on account of the grave nature of the charges. “I have read the six pre-bail reports all six accused are said to have a permanent place of abode. It is also apparent that there are residents within the county and each is well-known to the local administration.

Included in the stolen items were expensive paintings, religious statues made of ivory, and pieces made by known sculptors, including Maximo Vicente, Santiago Santos, and San Francisco Vecin. Two witnesses stated that on Oct. 1, the suspect was heard talking to a delivery rider on loudspeaker about having items picked up from Barangay Zambal.

A multi-agency squad of the Wildlife Wing of the Forest Department busted a gang of poachers and smugglers that hunted elephants in Similipal Tiger Reserve (STR) in Odisha’s Mayurbhanj district. Ten members of the gang were arrested during the past one week. Ivory, weighing over 30 kg, was seized from the possession of the arrested persons. This multi-agency squad comprised of personnel of the Similipal Tiger Protection Force (STPF), Joint Task Force (JTF) and multiple wildlife divisions and the wildlife divisions of Rairangpur and Puri. The arrest of four persons with 18 kg of ivory at Jashipur led to the unearthing of this elephant tusk racket. Interrogation of these four led to the revelation of a middleman operating from Puri. He was arrested by the JTF and Puri Wildlife Division. The information spilled by the arrested middleman led to the seizure of 12.9 kg of ivory at Karanjia and the arrest of five poachers from the bordering areas of Similipal Tiger Reserve.

A wildlife crime charity has smashed a “mafia-type” smuggling ring taking more than £95,000-worth of ivory out of Africa. A six-day operation by Conservation Justice, part of the EAGLE Network, and local agency partners in Gabon was described as a “significant turning point in the relentless fight against the illegal ivory trade”. Operatives for the charity, as well the Provincial Directorate of Water and Forestry and the Anti-Poaching Directorate of Gabon’s Moyen-Ogooué province, discovered the ivory hidden in secret compartments in a truck. The tusks are believed to have come from forest elephants and represent at least nine slaughtered animals. In total, 19 elephant tusks and four pieces of ivory weighing a total of 120kg were recovered. In China a kilogram of ivory is worth around 1,000 US dollars. The shipment also held 18 rounds of 458 caliber hunting ammunition which could be used to shoot and kill elephants. More than £1,000 in cash was also discovered. Approximately seven people were arrested in the operation including several “key players”, according to Luc Mathot, founding director of the NGO Conservation Justice. He said: “This type of operation is vital and should be repeated to dismantle the few large ivory trafficking networks that have managed to survive in Gabon, where the political will to protect the environment remains strong. “The forest elephant population is estimated at 95,000 and appears to be stable, making it their last big refuge. But the pressure remains, particularly from Cameroon.” From Cameroon the ivory is exported out of Africa to countries like China, as well as Europe and the US. According to Conservation Justice, the smuggling networks provide funds, ammunition and facilitates to transport the ivory from elephants killed by organised poachers, posing a serious threat to the survival of elephants and national security. Vehicles fitted with secret compartments are used to conceal the ivory and evade controls. More than a dozen people could be involved, with ivory drop-off points spread across various provinces of Gabon. The charity said “organised mafia-type networks” are prepared to do anything to enrich themselves. Ofir Drori, founder of the EAGLE network, which is active in a dozen countries including Cameroon and Gabon said: “The illegal wildlife trade is routed in corruption. This is a good example for that of a very criminal network driving elephants to extinction. ""It has already been caught once and rewarded with a ridiculous sentence only to continue their illegal activities undisturbed. One of the main leaders of the network was sentenced in Cameroon to a ridiculously low prison term despite being arrested with more than 600kg of ivory in 2020. And their illegal activities have continued undisturbed.”

The operation involved the Gabonese judicial police and government directorates of forestry and wildlife, with the support of the NGO Conservation Justice. In early August, police in the province of Moyen-Ogooué arrested a Gabonese man of Cameroonian origin, along with his wife. A search of their vehicle revealed a cache of 19 tusks and four pieces of ivory, weighing a total of 120kg. For context, 19 tusks mean at least nine elephants had been killed. The search also led to the confiscation of several rifle cartridges used for shooting big game, nearly 1 million CFA francs (about 1,500 euros) in cash, illicit substances and an expired residence permit belonging to a well-known Cameroonian ivory trafficker, according to Stephan Ekore Eko, an anti-poaching specialist at Gabon's Ministry of Water and Forests. Using fresh information from the suspect, the investigators were able to track down more traffickers. A total of ten people were arrested in separate locations, and nine of them were charged with involvement in “international ivory trafficking”, according to Jean Donald Ulrich Mbadinga, a legal expert with Conservation Justice. He said it took ten days for the operation to unravel the “vast network of international ivory traffickers in Gabon”. “The ivory is taken from Gabon, is trafficked across the border to Cameroon, and from Cameroon to Nigeria and from Nigeria to the Asian market,” he said in a video sent to RFI. He explained that the network functioned like a pyramid: “At the top, there is a leader who resides in Cameroon, and this leader works with collaborators who can be divided into two categories: the poachers’ canvassers and the transporters.” Canvassers comb the whole of Gabon in search of villagers who can kill elephants, Mbadinga explained. Then when the ivory is available, transporters to go with the canvassers to collect it. The ivory is then transported to Cameroon, he said. “This type of operation is vital and should be repeated to dismantle the few large ivory trafficking networks that have managed to survive in Gabon, where the political will to protect the environment remains strong,” says Luc Mathot, founding director of  Conservation Justice.

9 traffickers arrested with 21 elephant tusks weighing 131 kg in a crackdown on a major ivory trafficking ring using hidden compartments in vehicles. The seizure of 21 tusks and 4 ivory pieces is a mere snapshot of the regular activities of this vast network operating for many years with representatives and stations spread all over Gabon, Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon, trafficking ivory between Central and West Africa.

This network, that is estimated to have generated the killings of thousands of elephants, demonstrates that corruption is the main enabler of organized wildlife trafficking. One of its heads has been arrested in Cameroon 3 years ago with 600 kg ivory but was awarded a ridiculous sentence sending him right back to resume his illegal activities.

6 operations were carried to arrest the traffickers. The first and most crucial of the operations was carried out on August 8, when a Gabonese national of Cameroonian origin was arrested in Lambarene, Centre Gabon. He was driving a car with a partner inside. 19 elephant tusks and 4 pieces of ivory weighing a total of 120 kg were concealed in a hidden compartment of the vehicle. 18 rounds of 458 calibre ammunition, close to one million CFA francs in cash and an expired residence permit belonging to a well-known Cameroonian ivory trafficker were also uncovered in the car.

In the second week of August, four suspected poachers were arrested near the India-Bhutan border. Demanding strong actions to protect the wildlife in Manas National Park and Tiger Reserve in Assam, local people recently launched massive protests. They also urged the park authorities to punish the guilty and inefficient forest officials who failed to perform their duties because of which many animals fell prey to poachers in the last few months. The Greater Manas Conservation and Tourism Development Society, a local orgnaisation had alleged that in a few months, a number of tigers, elephants, wild buffalo, deer and pygmy hogs were killed by the poachers. The orgnisation apprehended that some forest officials might have been involved in these killings.

Gujarat seems to have become a hotbed for ivory smuggling in the country. A racket of illegal ivory trade that may amount to crores of rupees was busted by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) and forest department from Vadodara. Four members of the gang arrested were being questioned. Investigation revealed that a large number of ivory idols are being sold across the state in the garb of antique items.  Under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, elephant tusk and the sale of ivory produce are banned in India. Investigators said that the inter-state gang involved in the trade sold the ivory idols under the garb of antique items to elude forest officials. Four persons were arrested from Vadodara while some more arrests are expected from Ahmedabad and Rajkot soo, said forest officials. A kilogram of elephant tusk may cost anywhere between Rs 2-3 lakh in the black market. ""It's a state-wide racket wherein the key accused lure customers on social media. They post photos of the idols under the category of the antique item claiming that they are very rare,"" said Doki Adi Mallaiah, inspector, WCCB, western zone. During the investigation, WCCB learnt that such ivory idols were being traded in different cities of Gujarat. ""We tracked down one of the key accused Kiran Shah who used to sell the ivory idols in Vadodara. A decoy customer was first sent to gather more details and then Shah's shop was raided. We found many ivory idols there,"" Mallaiah told TOI. WCCB, the forest department and GSPCA (Gujarat Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) had in a joint operation raided a shop owned by Shah and found ivory idols along with two rhino horns in the city. Three other persons were also arrested in connection with the case. Names of the three accused other than Shah were not revealed by the investigators. Further investigations revealed that the gangs poaching elephant tusks smuggle them to artists in West Bangal and Rajasthan. There artists carve idols of gods, goddesses and other objects from the ivory that then makes its way to Gujarat. ""Traders in Gujarat sell these ivory idols. Many are also involved in money laundering and we may book those arrested under the concerned act,"" he added.

Subsequently, five other persons including the kingpin and those smuggling the tusks of the elephant were arrested along with the buyer,” said Nayagarh DFO Kshama Sarangi. Nanda appreciated the efforts of field staff of the two divisions who acted swiftly to crack the case without any rest for 48 hours. Interestingly, Khan was arrested in 2007 by a joint team of the Crime Branch (CB) and Forest department of which Nanda himself was a part. The smuggler was wanted in a case of ivory smuggling by the CB-CID and a team led by the then IG BK Sharma and Nanda, who was DFO Satkosia, had apprehended Khan. The other five accused were identified as Sanatan Naik, Satrughna Sinha, Tushar Ghanta, Sumanta Ghanta and Santosh Naik. They are all said to be natives of Gania and Daspalla area of Nayagarh district. After the arrest, sources said, clues regarding elephant poaching for ivory smuggling in the area in the last few years are getting unearthed.

The Nigeria Customs Service on Friday said it had arrested three men for alleged illegal export of elephant tusks to Asia. The men were arrested at different locations in Lagos between January 25, 2024, and February 4 and 6, 2024, for allegedly facilitating the sale and export of five pieces of elephant tusk, weighing 25.35kg, and worth about $16,000 equivalent (N23,520,000). It was gathered that the arrest involved the Customs Special Wildlife Office, and the Customs Police Unit during an intelligence-led, joint enforcement operation with the Wildlife Justice Commission. Nigeria is in a push to protect its dwindling elephant population from rampant wildlife traffickers, and Illegal wildlife export contravenes the Endangered Species Act and the Nigeria Customs Service Act. Over the past three decades, the country’s elephant population has declined drastically from an estimated 1,500 to less than 400 due to poaching for ivory, habitat loss, and human-elephant conflict, according to conservationists. The officer in charge of Nigeria Customs Service Special Wildlife Office, Assistant Comptroller Abim Isafiade said the Service is leaving no stone unturned in its commitment to end Illegal wildlife trade. He said that on January 9, 2024, Nigeria destroyed 2.5 tonnes of seized elephant tusks valued at over N9.9bn ($11.2 million). “The Service is determined to dismantle the wildlife criminal networks operating within the country. “Illegal wildlife trade or trafficking of wildlife is a criminal offence punishable under law, and so Nigeria Customs Service will continue to support global efforts to fight Wildlife crime. “The suspects will be charged to court as soon as investigations are concluded,” Isafiade said. Experts say tens of thousands of elephants are killed worldwide each year for their tusks.
That is despite a decades-long ban on the international trade of ivory. According to conservationists, Nigeria has become a hub for the illegal trade in animal parts from Africa. The biggest markets are said to be in Asia.

Three men were indicted by an East Texas grand jury and are accused of transporting two African elephant ivory tusks from an Oklahoma residence to Texas for sale.  According to their federal indictment, [redacted] called an undercover United States Fish and Wildlife special agent on Feb. 11, 2021 from Elk City to “negotiate the sale of an African elephant ivory tusk.”  The same day, a man documents identify as [redacted], allegedly posed with the African elephant tusks in Ardmore for photo and video recordings to promote the sale of the tusks. [redacted] then sent three photos and two videos to the undercover agent to negotiate the sale of the tusks, according to court documents. The tusks were valued at over $350. A few days later, documents state [redacted] called the undercover agent again to further negotiate the sale of the tusks where it was agreed the tusks would be transported to Tyler, Texas, to complete the transaction. Documents said a third man, [redacted], then moved the tusks with [redacted] “from a residence into the truck of a vehicle to transport them to Tyler.” The three have been charged with conspiracy to transport wildlife in interstate commerce, and [redacted] and [redacted] were additionally charged with transportation of wildlife in interstate commerce and violating the Endangered Species Act. The penalty range, if convicted, for conspiracy to transport wildlife and transportation of wildlife is a fine of $250,000 and five years in federal prison. The penalty range for violating the Endangered Species Act is a fine of $100,000 and one year in federal prison. “Behind every piece of ivory, whether it be a full tusk or carved trinket, is a dead elephant,” the World Wildlife Fund said in a previous statement on elephants. “Poachers kill about 20,000 elephants every single year for their tusks, which are then traded illegally in the international market to eventually end up as ivory trinkets. This trade is mostly driven by demand for ivory in parts of Asia.” According to court records, [redacted] appeared in a Tyler court on June 23 and his bond was set at $50,000. [redacted] appeared in court on Aug. 23 and was released without bail. They have both been set for trial in December unless a plea agreement is reached beforehand. [redacted] was transported to Smith County on Wednesday from an Oklahoma jail and according to a letter sent to the Eastern District of East Texas in July, [redacted] asked the clerk of court to “put off” his case while he underwent drug and alcohol treatment.

The Directorate of Revenue (DRI) officers on Wednesday unearthed a elephant tusk sale syndicate and arrested a gang of seven. Based on a tip-off, a team of officials intercepted three suspects in an autorickshaw on Tuesday and recovered ivory tusks concealed in a large bag from their possession. Based on their information, the DRI team arrested four additional accomplices involved in facilitating the illegal trade. Two elephant tusks, totally weighing 6.8 kg, were recovered and seized as per Section 50 of the Wildlife Protection Act (WPA), 1972. Initial probe revealed that the accused were part of a poachers gang operating in the forest area bordering Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. These area often are not patrolled well due to lack of coordination over jurisdictional issues, sources said. Following the arrest, the Forest Department officials have now stepped up combing operation to trace the body of the elephant which was killed by poachers to harvest the tusks. The tusks were being smuggled to Delhi and Kolkata market due to high demand for making ivory items, sources said.

Three Zambian nationals who were on Tuesday arrested for poaching in Katombola, near the Kazungula border post, were yesterday jailed for nine years each by a Zimbabwean court. Liston Muchelo (22), Alex Kakoma (22) and Martin Silitshebo (36) fired two shots at game rangers leading to a gunfire exchange which eventually resulted in the death of two accomplices. The trio were also found guilty of illegally entering the country and possessing ivory. Upon their arrest, the trio were found in possession of 15 elephant tusks weighing 128,82kgs, firearms and six live rounds of ammunition. It was also revealed that on March 19, the group of poachers entered Zimbabwe from Botswana through an illegal bush entry point near the Kazungula border post. The poachers are said to have intended to cross to Zambia, but while in Zimbabwe the accused persons proceeded to the Magumbeze area where they were arrested. Addressing graduates at Matusadona National Park in Kariba recently, Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks) director-general Fulton Mangwanya said poaching is a major concern and that there is need for more efforts to curb the vice.

The recent interception of a 20-foot container with 651 pieces of elephant ivory at the port of Maputo, Mozambique, is evidence that criminal networks driving the illegal wildlife trade remain a threat to global conservation efforts. It is critical that a thorough investigation take place, including using forensic science to assist in determining the potential geographic origin of these tusks, which likely extends beyond Mozambique into other elephant range states in southern or East Africa. Close cooperation between governments around the world will be essential to unravel this network. It’s also important to secure official stockpiles of ivory and ensure that there is no leakage from these sources. The vigilance of SERNIC and the Mozambican Tax Authority is to be applauded. This is a timely reminder that consumer demand for ivory remains in many countries, and the resolve of the global community to secure a viable future for Africa’s elephants must remain strong.

A joint task force in Mozambique has seized a shipping container containing 651 pieces of ivory hidden among sacks of corn, reports say. The shipment was bound for Dubai, however the UAE has no domestic market for ivory, according to its government. Instead, it serves as a transit point in order to circumvent efforts to crack down on the trafficking of ivory from Africa to East Asia. The operation comes nearly six years since the last major seizure by Mozambican authorities of 3,354 kilograms of ivory, also secreted away in a shipping container in Maputo, the country’s biggest port. The pieces found this month amount to less than 2,000 kilograms. The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) applauded the joint task force behind the seizure, which comprised officials from the National Investigation Service and the Mozambican Tax Authority. The IFAW also called for a thorough investigation, noting that such a large shipment of ivory was “evidence that the criminal network driving the illegal wildlife trade remains a threat to global conservation efforts.”

In a significant joint operation conducted by the Guwahati Special Task Force (STF) and Jonai Police, two large-sized ivory tusks were seized on April 10th. The operation, unfolding in the remote village of Kemi near the Assam-Arunachal Pradesh border, marked a crucial breakthrough in curbing illegal wildlife trafficking in the region. According to official reports, the operation was initiated after receiving intelligence about clandestine smuggling activities taking place in Jonai, particularly amidst the backdrop of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. The authorities uncovered a network of forest robbers covertly involved in lucrative smuggling ventures, which prompted the coordinated crackdown. The accused, identified as Dibas Pait, hailing from Kemi village in Assam, managed to evade arrest, exploiting the rugged terrain to his advantage. However, law enforcement officials successfully seized two ivory tusks, estimated to weigh approximately 15 kilograms. However, it added that the poacher behind the crime managed to flee from the scene taking advantage of the hostile terrain in the region. Accompanying the confiscated ivory was a motorcycle believed to be utilized in the smuggling operation. Legal proceedings against the perpetrator, Dibas Pait have been set in motion. The collaborative effort between the Guwahati STF and Jonai Police highlights the resolve to combat illicit activities threatening the region's biodiversity.

Body parts of wild animals were seized from a house in north Kolkata’s Nagerbazar area on Wednesday night, West Bengal Forest Minister Jyotipriya Mallick said. Six deer skins, two elephant tusks and two rhino horns were among the several items seized during a raid at the house that began at 4.30 pm and went on till late night, he told PTI. “It is suspected that these wildlife body parts were brought from the Northeast, and were meant for shipping to other parts of India. West Bengal appears to be a transit corridor in the operations of the racket,” Mallick said. The seized items are worth crores of rupees in the international black market, he said. Acting on a tip-off, a team of the Forest Department raided the house with the assistance of the Kolkata Police, he added. The owner of the house was held, and he seemed to be one of the key persons involved in the racket, Mallick said. An investigation is underway to identify the other persons involved in the racket, an official said. “Poaching has become zero in West Bengal. It appears to be the handiwork of an inter-state gang, having operatives in West Bengal. We are on the hunt for them,” Mallick said.
