In this operation mounted on September,10, 2021, one suspect Opio John David was arrested while the other Lt. Kakooza Bright Saad fled the scene of arrest. The illegal dealers had been trailed for over a week following credible leads from the UWA intelligence team that the two were intending to trade in some ivory pieces around Kampala.

The suspects were trailed for days by the UWA intelligence team to numerous Kampala suburbs. When positive identification of the suspects travelling in a Subaru car UBF 540S was finally confirmed, the intelligence team pursued the suspects to apprehend them. While racing to avoid arrest, the suspects driving the said Subaru car veered off the road knocking several cars and eventually grounding to a halt. â€œIt is then that one suspect was arrested and the other fled the scene of the crime. Upon search of the car, seven pieces of ivory, army uniform, boots, phones belonging to one of the suspects, and Civil Aviation Authorityâ€™s security pass were recovered from the car,â€ UWA stated. The search is on to apprehend the other suspect who fled the scene. The suspects will be aligned before the courts of law and charged accordingly. This, according to UWAâ€™s executive director, Sam Mwandha, sends a signal to all wildlife offenders that once caught they will be arrested and prosecuted. â€œThe news of more arrests should echo in the ears of whoever is thinking of involving themselves in wildlife crimes to desist from such actions.

In the town of LambarÃ©nÃ© in western Gabon, three alleged wildlife traffickers have just fallen into the net of the judicial police. They were arrested in possession of approximately 81 kg of ivory. The loot was stolen from the ivory storage warehouse of the LambarÃ©nÃ© court of first instance. The recent operation against wildlife trafficking in the town of LambarÃ©nÃ© in western Gabon was successful. On 23 June 2022, a trio of alleged wildlife traffickers were arrested. All Gabonese nationals, the suspects were preparing to sell six whole elephant tusks as well as seventeen pieces of ivory tips and a panther skin carefully stored in suitcases and travel bags, when they were apprehended. The total weight of the catch was around 81 kg of ivory. Curiously, the marked ivory pieces, according to the defendants, came from the seals of the LambarÃ©nÃ© court of first instance. With the help of two accomplices working for this court, the alleged traffickers are said to have robbed the storage warehouse of the seized ivory pieces. The success of this operation was due to the joint intervention of the judicial police, the General Directorate of Wildlife and Protected Areas (DGFAP) and the Provincial Directorate of Water and Forests, supported by Conservation Justice, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) working for the application of the wildlife law. The alleged traffickers will have to answer for the possession and attempted sale of trophies of fully protected species. They were taken into custody at the LambarÃ©nÃ© judicial police station pending their presentation to the Special Prosecutorâ€™s Office in Libreville. The latter has been dealing with this type of case for the past three years, with the result that 80-90% of the ivory traffickers arrested have been sentenced to prison terms of up to 10 years for ivory trafficking. Cases of wildlife trafficking involving law enforcement officers are becoming a concern in Gabon. â€œThese organised networks in the various types of lucrative trafficking must be firmly combated, as they can dramatically erode the rule of law by diverting certain servants of the law from their prerogatives and duties,â€ explains Conservation Justice in a note. The vulnerability of the storage sites for seized ivory and hunting weapons encourages ivory trafficking in Gabon. And in 2020, tips were stolen from the LambarÃ©nÃ© Court and tips from the Libreville Court were even seized in neighbouring Cameroon. In 2015, nearly 300 kg of ivory disappeared from the court in Oyem in the north of the country. The 2012 audit report on government ivory stocks states that ivory tusks registered at the LambarÃ©nÃ© court had disappeared. A year earlier in 2011, another report by the National Parks Agency revealed the disappearance of 17 ivory tusks from the Makokou court stockpile in the north-east of the country.

Pangolin traffickers get sentences ranging from 30 months to eight years in prison. On January 16, 2019, National Economic Police, in cooperation with Huong Son District Police, raided a home in Huong Son district of Ha Tinh and discovered 215 Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica) in the possession of the owner. Twelve people were arrested in connection with the case, and a search of a second home resulted in the discovery of a small quantity of ivory as well. The pangolins were reportedly smuggled into Vietnam from Laos. At the time of the seizure, only 167 of the 215 pangolins were alive. The surviving pangolins were subsequently transferred to the Carnivore and Pangolin Rescue Center of Cuc Phuong National Park. On January 14, 2020, 12 subjects were convicted by Huong Son District Court. Two subjects were sentenced to 8 years in prison and each fined VND 70 million. Another subject was sentenced 2 years 9 months in prison and fined VND 60 million. Two other subjects were sentenced 2 years 6 months in prison and were each fined VND 50 million.

Police in north-central Vietnam have arrested nine people for allegedly trapping 215 pangolins to traffic them. The animals, weighing a total 600 kilograms, were found at three locations in Ha Tinh Provinceâ€™s Huong Son District by officers from the Ministry of Public Security and the local police department. They also found an item weighing a kilogram that they suspect is ivory. The five women and four men in custody are all locals and the police are investigating further. Pangolin trafficking is not rare in Vietnam, where it is legally protected and categorized as endangered. The shy, tiny creature, which resembles a scaly anteater, is the world's most heavily trafficked mammal despite bans. Pangolins are hunted in Vietnam and its neighborhood for their meat and the alleged medicinal properties of their scales. Of the 10 countries and territories with the largest number of trafficking incidents, seven were in Asia -- China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand, Laos, and Indonesia â€“ a study by wildlife trade monitoring group Traffic and Australiaâ€™s University of Adelaide in December 2017 had found.

Authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo have seized 2 metric tons of ivory in the city of Lubumbashi, a hub for ivory trafficking. The May 14 seizure is one of the largest in recent years, according to Adams Cassinga, who heads Conserv Congo, an NGO that fights wildlife trafficking and which took part in the operation. The seized ivory is estimated to be worth $6 million. Authorities arrested three people, believed to be members of one of the major wildlife trafficking rings in the region. The network is linked to the smuggling of 20 metric tons of ivory in the past five years alone. The latest seizure represents more than 150 elephants killed for their tusks, Cassinga said. The tusks originated from countries in Southern Africa, which has seen a surge in ivory trafficking in the 2000s, fueled by demand from Asia, particularly China. Ivory found in a stash house in Lubumbashi, the Democratic Republic of Congo. Image courtesy of Adams Cassinga/Conserv Congo. At the height of the crisis, 30,000 elephants were being killed every year, an average of 80 a day. African elephant populations have shrunk by 80% in the past 100 years, according to an analysis by WWF. The African savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana) is considered endangered on the IUCN Red List, while the forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) is critically endangered, only a step away from being extinct in the wild. Poaching has declined in recent years, a 2021 report by Geneva-based nonprofit Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC) found. One of the factors cited for the dip is the weakening of criminal networks because of raids and arrests. â€œThe reduced poaching seems to be the result of the dismembering through arrests and prosecutions of a large number of transnational organized criminal networks involved in ivory poaching and trafficking in East and southern Africa between 2014 and 2020,â€ the GI-TOC report said. The Lubumbashi raid was led by the DRCâ€™s top conservation authority, known by its French acronym, the ICCN. It included members of the national police force, court officials and the NGO Conserv Congo. The team recovered the ivory from a stash house in Lubumbashi in the southern DRC. Traffickers brought the poached parts into the DRC from Zambia, which lies on the countryâ€™s southern border. Lubumbashi has emerged as a major hub from where poached wildlife parts are funneled out of Africa. The items originate primarily in Southern African countries like South Africa, Zimbabwe and Zambia. â€œWe are sure it will bring a great deal of deterrence in a place where previously wildlife laws were neglected and not applied,â€ Cassinga said in a tweet. Weak enforcement of laws, armed conflict and corruption have allowed international gangs to operate with impunity in western and Central Africa. The DRC, which shares borders with nine countries, serves as an important transit point for the movement of trafficked parts. The Central African nation, which hosts the largest swath of Congo Basin rainforest, is also a source country for illegal wildlife goods. Yet, from 2000 to 2014, when elephant poaching was rampant, the DRC recovered only around 8 metric tons of ivory in seizures. Then, between 2015 and 2019, authorities there confiscated 20 metric tons, according to data collected by the Environmental Investigation Agency, an NGO based in the U.K. â€œWe are making strong efforts to take down all the illegal trade networks. With time, we have bigger impacts on the illegal networks,â€ Olivier Mushiete, head of the ICCN, said in a phone interview with Mongabay. The Lubumbashi raid follows a series of raids in the DRC capital, Kinshasa, last year. Mushiete told Reuters at that time that they expect to recover more than 60 metric tons in future seizures. The current operation was a result of three years of investigation. â€œThe relationship between the government and the civil society is improving. You can see that it is yielding results,â€ Cassinga said. He added that support from partners like Zambia-based Wildlife Crime Prevention and international donors like the Rhino Recovery Fund is helping them combat wildlife trafficking. The skull of an elephant recently killed by poachers who ripped out its tusks in Province Orientale, DRC. Ivory poaching is one of the most lucrative illicit trades, valued at around $23 billion a year, according to Bloomberg. CITES, the global convention on the wildlife trade, banned the international commercial trade in ivory in 1989. However, some countries continue to allow domestic trade and international trade, subject to varying degrees of regulation. In the past decade, efforts to curb ivory demand have gathered pace, with the U.S. imposing a near-complete ban on elephant ivory trade in 2016 and China banning the domestic trade in 2017. The EU tightened its rules on the ivory trade in 2021. Narrower exemptions limit the legal ivory trade, which conservationists say often serves as a cover for unlawful transactions. The three suspected traffickers from the Lubumbashi raid are due to appear in court this week. Even if seizures and arrests increase, the impact on poaching could be limited by countriesâ€™ failure to prosecute alleged traffickers. Coordinating cross-border investigations and amassing the necessary evidence is tricky. Wildlife crimes are often not prioritized by law enforcement agencies or judicial authorities. The arrest of two Vietnamese nationals during the seizure of 3.3 metric tons of ivory from Ugandaâ€™s capital, Kampala, in 2019 did not result in convictions; both suspects skipped bail. Raids also tend to net intermediaries but rarely lead to the capture of those who organize, fund and benefit the most from this illegal trade. â€œAs far as dismantling the network, that is unlikely. It may be slowed down,â€ said Chris Morris, who works with the Kenya-based organization Saving Elephants through Education and Justice (SEEJ). â€œThese cartels are a business. They are prepared for losses from seizures and arrests.â€

An international police operation coordinated by Interpol targeting the movement of illicit firearms in Central and West Africa has led to some 120 arrests and the seizure of firearms, gold, drugs, fake medication, wildlife products and cash. Operation Trigger VIII, which ran from June 13 to June 19, involved some 520 law enforcement officials targeting 35 hotspots across eight African countries: Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania and Niger. More than 20,000 checks were carried out against Interpolâ€™s global databases, resulting in the recovery of 480 firearms and 42 arrests tied to firearms offences. In addition, 14 organized crime networks were identified and dismantled. Authorities seized some 6,000 firearm parts, components, ammunition and explosives, and EUR 110,000 in cash. Reinforced border controls and surveillance once again demonstrated that organized crime groups are benefiting from a convergence of crimes and using the same routes for a number of illicit activities. An additional 78 arrests were made in connection with trafficking in illicit goods, with more than 45 tonnes seized, including more than 3 of fake medication, 1.5 tonnes of drugs (cannabis, amphetamines and opioids) and more than 10,000 litres of contraband petrol. Some 40 tonnes of fins of endangered shark species were recovered in Guinea, while authorities in the Central African Republic dismantled a network suspected of supplying poachers with firearms and ammunition. The Democratic Republic of Congo reported the seizure of 141 elephant tusks. With illicit gold mining suspected of financing terrorism and armed militant groups in the Sahel region, authorities also launched more than 85 active investigations into the links between firearms trafficking, transnational organized crime and terrorism financing. More than 26 kg of illicitly mined gold and 170 kg of explosives were seized during the operation. â€œIn a Sahel region plagued by insecurity, I welcome the undertaking of such an operation, which contributes to the strengthening of international police cooperation, the only guarantee of success in the fight against terrorism and other forms of crime,â€ said Roger Ouedraogo, Director General of Burkina Fasoâ€™s National Police. Interpol Secretary General JÃ¼rgen Stock added: â€œOperations such as Trigger VIII underscore how firearms trafficking represents a grave transnational threat, facilitating the activities of organized crime networks and terrorist groups.â€ â€œThey also highlight the connections between different types of criminality and the continued need for cooperation between countries and across regions,â€ added Secretary General Stock.

AUTHORITIES IN SOUTHEASTERN DR Congo have seized one and a half tonnes of elephant ivory, legal and environmental officials said, in one of the largest hauls in Africa in years. Officers discovered the smuggled tusks aboard trucks in the city of Lubumbashi on Saturday, according to a legal official who declined to be named due involvement in an ongoing investigation into the affair. Police arrested five people but two fled after questioning, the official said. He added that the haul amounted to 1.5 tonnes. Both the origin and intended final destination of the ivory remain unclear. Sabin Mande, a lawyer for a coalition of environmental groups, told AFP that he had seen 18 bags of seized ivory in the state prosecutorâ€™s office in Lubumbashi yesterday. The contraband represents 80 to 100 slaughtered elephants, he said. The seizure marks one of the largest in Africa in years. In 2013, Kenyan officials made several seizures including one of four tonnes. Togolese authorities likewise seized four tonnes of ivory over the course of one week in 2014. In 2019, Vietnamese officials discovered over nine tonnes of elephant ivory in a shipment carrying timber from the Republic of Congo, also known as Congo-Brazzaville, in the largest recent haul worldwide.

A shipment of one and a half tons of smuggled ivory was seized last weekend and three suspected traffickers arrested in Lubumbashi, in the southeast of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a judicial source said Thursday. The origin and destination of the ivory are not known, an investigation is underway. â€œOn Saturday, our services seized some 1,500 kg of ivory,â€ said this judicial source, who did not wish to be identified. â€œFive people who were transporting the ivory in long trucks were arrested but two fled after questioning,â€ the source added. According to the source, â€œthe three Congolese arrested say they were simple transporters, who do not know the origin or final destination of the packages and claim that those who fled are the owners. Mr. Sabin Mande, a lawyer for the â€œNatural Resources Networkâ€, a platform of Congolese environmental NGOs, said he had seen on Wednesday at the public prosecutorâ€™s office in Lubumbashi, the capital of Haut-Katanga, â€œ18 bags full of ivory weighing a total of more than 1,500 kgâ€. According to him, this represents the slaughter of â€œ80 to 100 elephantsâ€. â€œThis is criminal,â€ he commented. This is one of the largest ivory seizures made on the African continent. Seizures of two to four tons have been made in Kenya and Togo in the last ten years. The largest recent seizure in the world was made in Vietnam, with nine tons discovered in March 2019 on a ship from Congo.

In a major operation, officials of the Karnataka Police Department and Tamil Nadu Forest Departments came together to arrest an inter-state gang in connection with a recent ivory smuggling case. In what can only be described as a well-coordinated interdepartmental approach, both the accused were arrested by the officials for their involvement in transporting ivory across the state border on February 16. The officials from Tamil Nadu Forest Department tied up the loose end for Hebbaguddi police officials by nabbing both the absconding men and handing them over to the officials for further interrogation. Earlier, the Hebbaguddi police officials had arrested six men while they were transporting a pair of tusks weighing 14 kilograms. Officials say that all six arrested were only the middlemen. â€œThe main accused were at large. We have now arrested two men â€“ Pavan Raj and Basavaraj,â€ informed Karthikeyani K, wildlife warden, Hosur forest division, Tamil Nadu Forest Department. Karthikeyani said, â€œWe were tipped off on their whereabouts through local intelligence. Once we had their addresses, we arrested one of the accused from his home, whereas the second accused was nabbed later from the neighborhood,â€ said. â€œSo far, the accused have maintained that the tusks were not obtained from a live animal. As per the information they are divulging, they found the tusks in a rocky area around their village in Hosur. However, further interrogation is on,â€ said a police official. Wildlife experts say that this is a clear case of poaching and there should be comprehensive inquiry into the issue. Sharath Babu, a wildlife enthusiast, said: â€œIt is not a case of tusks collection after the animal has shed it naturally. The animal, in all probability, was shot and the tusks were harvested. Tusks that are shed naturally look different.â€ He further stated, â€œOne of the tusks is larger than the other. When an elephant is shot by an untrained hunter, the animal either falls on its left or its right. So, while the tusk facing the sky can be easily harvested, the one on the ground cannot be taken out completely because of the weight of the animal.â€

According to our source, FranÃ§ois Moukambi Moubeyi, a 48-year-old Gabonese, was caught in possession of two ivory spikes cut into four pieces that he was about to sell in one of the rooms of a motel in the city. Questioned as soon as he was arrested, the surveyor by training tried from the outset to exonerate himself by claiming not to be the owner of the ivory found in his possession. It was only after several hours of interrogation that he cited a certain Jean-Marie Pilima, a 70-year-old Gabonese, as the person who had given him the prohibited product. The latter will be apprehended in turn in another district of the city. However, unlike his colleague Moukambi, Pilima showed good faith by driving without the slightest hesitation, the agents to the home of Mohamed Backo (Gabonese 50 years old) whom he had previously designated as the true owner of the two points. The three individuals were taken and placed in police custody in the premises of the Directorate General of Research (DGR), pending transfer to Libreville to be presented before the Public Prosecutor at the specialized formation of the Court of First Instance of Libreville. Under the provisions of the new Criminal Code in force, they face up to 10 years' imprisonment. This operation owes its success to the synergy of the team that led it. It was composed of agents of the provincial branch of the General Directorate of Research of OgoouÃ©-Ivindo and an agent of the Provincial Directorate of Water and Forests, supported by the NGO Conservation Justice.

The Malawi police in Nkhotakota are keeping in custody a 34-year-old man for allegedly entering into protected Nkhotakota Game Reserve and killing an Elephant. This happened after Parks and Wildlife Assistants (PWA) on Tuesday December 10, 2019 arrested him inside the game reserve. According to Nkhotakota Police Public Relations Officer, Sub Inspector Williams Kaponda, the suspect was identified as Samuel Kaliati. Kaponda said he was found with a pair of Ivory weighing about 31 kilograms which according to game officials was removed from an Elephant worthy about MK19Million which he killed. â€œIn August this year, the suspect entered Nkhotakota game reserve and searched for an Elephant trail along Lisitu River. â€œHe put bread contaminated with acid poison deliberately for the Elephant to eat. Three days later, he killed one Elephant a few meters from where he put the poisoned bread.â€ he said. Kaponda said following a tip from community members that Kaliati was keeping Ivory illegally, on October 9, the Parks and Wildlife Assistants tricked him as potential buyers. â€œThe officers instigated for a meeting to buy the commodity. However, the deal flawed as the suspect, while negotiating for the price got suspicious and ran away,â€ he added. The police spokesperson said Ivory was immediately confiscated and the suspect was only arrested two-months afterwards (on December 10, 2019) upon his return in the village. The suspect will soon appear before the court of law to answer charges of entering into protected area and killing protected species without permission contrary to section 32 and 33 respectively of National Parks and Game Reserve Act of 2017. The suspect hails from Mugando village, senior chief Kanyenda in Nkhotakota district.

According to Malayattoor Division Forest Office, around 416 kg of ivory artefacts were seized from the accused persons in connection with the poaching case. The Forest Department charge sheeted 41 persons and the trial in the case is yet to begin. Sudheesh Chandra Babu, an accused in the case who was absconding, was arrested along with his daughter Amritha by sleuths attached to the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) Kolkata unit from Kona Expressway near Santragachi Railway Station on Monday [11/03/2019].  Elephant tusks weighing 3.144 kgs, worth `30.93 lakh were seized from the duo. Further, the DRI team raided residential premises on Rajdhanga Road based on the information provided by the duo and seized ivory idols and jewellery worth `72.35 lakh. As per the information provided by the duo, the idols were made from elephant tusks procured from Kerala. Train tickets seized from Sudheesh Chandra Babu corroborated the information that he travelled from Kottayam to Santragachi with the contraband goods. Wildlife Crime Control Bureau sources said the family has been on the radar of forest sleuths for at least four years. The familyâ€™s involvement in poaching was revealed in 2015 after the confession of a former forest watcher who moonlighted as a guide for poachers led to the arrest of 50 persons and seizure of over 400kg of ivory. The tusks seized on Monday were en route to Nepal, a senior DRI official said. â€œSudheesh and his daughter would have sold the tusks to a buyer in Calcutta who would then send them to Nepal via Siliguri,â€ the official said.

Smuggled elephant tusks of around Rs 1 crore were recovered at the Khoribari forest area of Darjeeling in a joint operation by Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) and West Bengal police, police sources said here on Friday. Three persons have been arrested in this connection. The three arrested have been identified as Asit Oraon, Anil Oraon and Punilal Nagachia. While Asit and Anil are residents of the Fulbari area, Punilal belongs to Garidhura. Based on a tip-off that a group of wildlife smugglers were trying to smuggle an elephant calf in a mini-truck through the Khoribari forest area, a joint team of district police and SSB personnel launched a search operation. Finally, the vehicle was apprehended at the Ghoshpukur forest range in the Khoribari area. However, instead of the calf, smuggled elephant tusks were recovered from their possession. The estimated market value of the item seized will be to the tune of Rs 1 crore,"" a state police official said. The three persons arrested could not furnish any document or provide any information regarding the tusks. This made the sleuths believe that the items seized were meant for smuggling. The police are currently interrogating the three to track their other associates. According to police, this particular belt in north Bengal has become a hotbed of wildlife smuggling. Just six days ago, a Trinamool Congress leader in the adjacent Alipurduar district was arrested by sleuths of the state's forest department while attempting to smuggle a pangolin. The arrested person was identified as James Borogaon (53), who is the deputy chief of the Khoyardanga-2 village panchayat. A pangolin was also recovered from his possession.

Vietnamese authorities have over the past week seized more than 600 kilograms of ivory smuggled from Africa, the government said on Monday. Trade in ivory is illegal in Vietnam but wildlife trafficking remains widespread. Other items often found smuggled into the country include pangolin scales, rhino horns and tiger carcasses. Customs authorities in the northern port city of Haiphong on Monday found nearly 130 kilograms of ivory hidden in a container of cow horns originated from Africa, the government said in a statement. This followed the finding of nearly 500 kilograms of African ivory on Thursday last week at Lach Huyen Port in the city, the government said. This has been the largest seizure of smuggled ivory in the country in more than four years. The authorities had in October 2018 seized more than eight tonnes of ivory and pangolin scales in one of the country's largest wildlife trafficking cases for years.

Some of the Exhibits Upon probing, Tomusange led Police detectives and the Conservationists from NRCN to the home of the former Italian Consul, where a further house search was done, leading to the discovery of more 3.75Kgs of worked Ivory pieces. â€˜â€™On Saturday [10/04/2021], an officer of the NCRN had received a call from a whistle blower who tipped him that there was someone in Luzira with some Kilogrammes of Ivory to sell. The Officer immediately informed Police about the developmentâ€™â€™, added a source. The following Sunday [11/04/2021], the officers of the NRCNâ€“ Uganda, with Police, met their informer, who showed them the ivory from a hidden sack. â€˜â€™On confirming that the items in the sack were genuine Ivory pieces, the detectives immediately introduced themselves to Tomusange and arrested him. They then demanded that he takes them to the source of the Ivoryâ€™â€™, revealed an official from NRCN. [MOR35046]. Tomusange led the detectives to the residence of the diplomat, where a stand-off ensued, between the detectives and the Diplomatâ€™s caretakers, who denied access. In the ensuing struggle for access to carry out a search, the caretakers released a guard dog which bit and injured one of the detectives on the left arm, before it was eventually subdued. In his statement to Police at Bugolobi Police Station, Mr Diego Marino did not deny that he was the owner of the Ivory pieces. Nonetheless, he says he had bought them several years ago from a hawker who he hasnâ€™t identified. â€œI donâ€™t sell Ivory. I have been here for over 10 years. I bought these things from a hawker here in Kampalaâ€, Diego told the detectives from Bugolobi Police station. In Uganda though, offences related to trafficking in Wildlife are Strict Liability offences, meaning that regardless of what the defendantâ€™s intents or mental state was when committing the act, possession of those materials can constitute criminal liability. The Officer in Charge Investigations at the Bugolobi Police station, James Mutaire, says Mr Diego Marino will be charged with 2 counts against wildlife. â€œWe prefer 2 charges against him. One is Unlawful Possession of Specimen of Protected Wildlife contrary to Section 36 (1), and Section 71(1)(B) of the Uganda Wildlife Act, and secondly, Unlawful Transfer of Specimen of Protected Species contrary to Section 36(1) and Section 71 (1)(B) of the Uganda Wildlife Actâ€, said Mutaire. Exhibits On Monday, Experts from the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) joined the team of the Natural Resource Conservation Network (NRCN) to help with identification and prosecution of the suspects. In her 6 â€“ page technical report dated April 13, 2021, an UWA Sergeant Major Twinamatsiko Harriet noted that she had confirmed that the 5.5Kgs of specimens handed to her by the police were actually of protected wildlife. â€œHaving closely examined the features of the specimens as above and relating them with the known features of an Elephant and Hippopotamus, it was 99.9% highly probable that the specimens were 56 cut worked elephant Ivory pieces and one worked hippopotamus incisor tooth.â€ She said that her findings meant that at least 3 endangered animal species could have been killed to extract the pieces she observed. â€œAt least two elephants died to obtain the specimens as described above considering the fact that an elephant has a pair of tusks and there were two complete worked tusks and several chopped ones. At least a hippopotamus died to obtain the one piece of the hippopotamus incisor tooth because the hippopotamus incisor belongs to the hippopotamus.

Cameroonian Customs officials last week seized 118 ivory tusks weighing approximately 626 kg, carefully hidden in a truck of merchandise at Ambam, in the Southern region of Cameroon. It is the largest seizure made in the area, where the three countries of Cameroon, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea meet. One suspect was caught at the scene and is reported to be a Cameroonian arriving from Gabon and has connections to an international wildlife trafficking network according to Cameroonian officials involved in the investigation. The size of the seizure is above the 500 kg threshold considered under Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) guidelines to be indicative of organised criminal activity and thus warrants full follow up investigations. â€œTRAFFIC congratulates Cameroonian Customs for this important seizure, and in line with CITES guidelines, we urge the authorities to carry out thorough forensic examination of the shipment and liaise with enforcement colleagues in any other countries implicated in the trafficking to try and bring the perpetrators to justice,â€ said Denis Mahonghol, TRAFFICâ€™s Director for Central Africa.

Thirty-six (36) months' imprisonment and a fine of 50,000 Fcfa. 100,000 Fcfa in damages and restitution of trophies to the Borgou Forest Inspectorate. This is the decision of the Parakou Court of First Instance in the case of the detention, transport and attempted marketing of seven (7) ivory tips weighing 19.25 kg seized on Friday, June 26, 2020 in the same city. It is easy to see that the court spared no effort to render a dissuasive decision against this trafficker in ivory from at least four (4) elephants slaughtered in protected areas. Because these pachyderms killed for their defenses is a huge loss for biodiversity.

On September 9, the surging news (www.thepaper.cn) reporter learned from Shanghai Customs that recently, when supervising an inbound flight, the customs of Pudong International Airport under Shanghai Customs used advanced machine inspection intelligent means to lock a bag with abnormal images, and after comparison and analysis, it was found that there were unique imaging characteristics of ivory products, and immediately issued an order to control and block. After the passenger picks up the luggage, he selects the ""no-declaration channel"" in the arrival hall and does not declare any items to the customs, and the on-site customs officer stops and inspects him. After a thorough inspection of the box, the customs officer found a total of 4 milky white bracelets and bracelets, weighing about 310 grams, in a yellow bag. The objects had a crossed texture and belonged to the ""Shi's structure"" peculiar to ivory products, which travelers reported having been purchased from Nigeria on request. At present, the above-mentioned items have been detained and handed over to the relevant authorities for further processing. Since January 2018, 1, China has completely stopped the commercial processing and sale of ivory and ivory products. In recent years, most of the ivory products seized at airports and ports have been carried into China by tourists and migrant workers in Africa, and they have taken risks out of curiosity, entrusted by others, and driven by interests, paying a big price for small items.

Trade in ivory is illegal in Vietnam but wildlife trafficking remains widespread. Other items often found smuggled into the country include pangolin scales, rhino horns and tiger carcasses. Customs authorities in Haiphong City on Monday found the ivory hidden in a container declared to customs as peanuts, the government said in a statement, adding that the cargo had transited via Singapore.

A shipment that contains at least seven tons of elephant tusks from Africa was discovered recently in Hai Phong, the largest such haul ever recorded in the northern port city.
Local authorities said Monday they had found the tusks, which were illegally trafficked from Africa in three suspicious containers. The containers belonged to a haul that began in Angola, was then transported to Singapore, and finally to the Nam Hai Dinh Vu Port in Hai Phong. The containers were inspected when authorities noticed that the receiverâ€™s details were labeled inaccurately. One container alone contained over 7 tons of elephant tusks, and authorities said the total amount of trafficked goods could amount to dozens of tons. The Hai Phong Customs Department said the amount of elephant tusks found was the largest haul to ever be discovered in the city.

On April 25, Noi Bai International Airport Customs Branch detected many violations at the International Terminal T2 of Noi Bai International Airport. As a result, the branch coordinated with Team No.7 under Ha Noi City Police, the Northern Anti-Smuggling Enforcement Unit and the Noi Bai International Airport Police to inspect and supervise the luggage and goods of a passenger named N.B.D. entering Noi Bai International Airport from Doha with suspicious signs.

After inspecting the two luggage packages of N.B.D via the portable X-ray scanner, the branch detected suspicious rhino horns and ivory.

Through a physical inspection, the law enforcement forces discovered four cylindrical blocks of animal horns suspected to be rhino horns and 37 circular blocks suspected to be products made from ivory in the passengerâ€™s baggage.

The on-site verification results of the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology representative show that four animal horns are rhino horns; 37 circular blocks are made from ivory. According to the verification results of the Criminal Technology Division - Hanoi City Police, four rhino horns weigh more than 11.8 kg and 37 circular blocks made from ivory weigh 4.7 kg.

According to the declaration, on March 29, Mr N.B.D. carried out exit procedures from Vietnam to Angola. Until April 21, the suspect was on a flight from Angola to Doha (Qatar) and entered Vietnam. In Angola, Mr N.B.D. was paid V.N.D. 50 million by a man named Chung to transport two packages containing rhino horn and ivory to Vietnam.

When Mr N.B.D. transited at Doha Airport, the local law enforcement forces requested him to open a pack of baggage, detected four pieces of rhino horn wrapped with foil, and seized the above package.

On April 24, the competent authority at Doha allowed Mr N.B.Ä to return to Vietnam with one luggage package.

Mr N.B.D admitted that Mr Chung hired him to transport the packages to Vietnam; when he returned to Vietnam, someone would contact him to receive the packages, but no one had contacted him. Notably, Mr N.B.D. said he did not know Mr Chung. However, Mr Chung actively contacted and hired him to transport rhino horns and ivory to Vietnam, and this was the first time Chung hired him to transport these goods.

Customs officers at Noi Bai International Airport have recently halted a haul of 11.8 kilograms of rhino horns and 4.7 kilograms of ivory elephant tusks smuggled into Vietnam. Rhino horns and elephant tusks have been found in luggage carried by a Vietnamese travelling from Doha to Hanoi. The package was owned by a Vietnamese man travelling on a flight from Doha (Qatar) to Vietnam on April 24, according to the police.  The man confessed that he had been hired by a man named Chung to transport two parcels of rhino horns and elephant tusks from Angola to Doha before bringing them to Vietnam for VND50 million. A further investigation into the case is currently underway. Vietnam is considered a hotspot for the illegal trade of wildlife products, including elephant ivory, rhino horns, tiger parts, and pangolins. These products are often considered a status symbol and are used for decorations and medicine, despite the lack of scientific proof of their medicinal properties. Vietnamese laws prohibit the hunting, killing, trade, or transportation of wild animals, although the high returns continue to lure many people into trafficking networks.

The Ahmedabad police on Wednesday arrested a man allegedly involved in smuggling and selling valuable animal parts at an international level.

During questioning, it was revealed that the accused, Prakash Chunilal Jain, had connections to the notorious Sandalwood thief, Veerappan.

He lived in the Salem area of Tamil Nadu from 1992 to 2006, used to visit Veerappanâ€™s village Koltur from time-to-time and was also aware of the name of Veerappanâ€™s wife.

He was also involved in obtaining large quantities of ivory through Veerappanâ€™s gang members.

This information prompted the Ahmedabad Crime Branch team to collaborate with the Tamil Nadu Police and the Tamil Nadu Forest Department, leading to the registration of a case against the accused for the illegal sale of animal remains.

Acting on the instructions of the Joint Commissioner of Police and Deputy Commissioner of Police, under the guidance of the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Crime Branch, A.D. Parmar, the team of officers from the City Crime Branch successfully apprehended Prakash from Bodakdev, Ahmedabad.

The accused, wanted under various sections of the Wild Animals (Protection) Act, 1972, including Sections 2, 39(b), 44, 49(b), 50, and 51, was handed over to officials from the Tamil Nadu Forest Departmentâ€™s Trichy range.

The crime registered was initially reported in the Tiruchirappalli range of Trichy, Tamil Nadu, where Prakash was found illegally selling the remains of various animals, including one tiger skin, two ivory, two deer horns and one fox tail.

This arrest is not the first encounter the accused has had with the law.

Previously, the Ahmedabad Crime Branch apprehended Prakash one-and-a-half months ago for the possession of elephant tusks worth Rs 35 lakh.

A case was registered under Section 379, 411 of the IPC and Section 39, 43(1), 43(2) of the Wild Animals (Protection) Act, 1972. Legal action was taken accordingly.

The continuous surveillance and investigation by the Crime Branch team culminated in the arrest of the accused, who has now been handed over to the Tamil Nadu Forest Department for further legal proceedings.

The owner of a Manhattan-based antiques store, along with his corporation, was charged with multiple felonies in connection with illegal ivory sales in New York County Criminal Court Wednesday, according to the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC).

Alexander Sakhai and Alexander's Antiques Inc., of 1050 Second Ave., were each charged with two counts of Illegal Commercialization of Fish, Shellfish, Crustaceans and Wildlife, a class E felony, and two counts Illegal Commercialization of Fish, Shellfish, Crustaceans and Wildlife, a class D felony.

DEC Environmental Conservation Police Officers (ECOs), working undercover on a tip, purchased an illegal ivory item from the store in July earlier this year. The item was brought to the American Museum of Natural History for morphological analysis, and experts there determined that the piece was carved from authentic elephant ivory.

A search warrant executed on July 21 by ECOs from DEC's Bureau of Environmental Crimes Investigation (BECI) unit revealed that the store was selling approximately 130 illegal ivory items in excess of $25,000. As part of the search warrant, the items were confiscated.

MANHATTAN (CN) - The owner of an antique shop in New York Cityâ€™s affluent Sutton Place enclave pleaded guilty Thursday to felonies related to his sale of illegal elephant ivory.

Alexander Sakhaiâ€™s plea follows a July 21 raid of his Second Avenue shop Alexander's Antiques in which authorities confiscated 130 illegal ivory items worth at least $25,000.

One of several raids conducted by the state in recent years, New York is striving to crack down on a trade that pulls in between $7 billion and $23 billion per year.

America ranks alongside China as the primary destinations for the ivory black market, and New York recently dropped from first to third place as a U.S. destination for ivory products.

In addition to ramping up prosecutions, the state has made several public spectacles in recent years of destroying the seized ivory. At one such display in August, authorities used a conveyor belt to feed $8.5 million worth of artifacts, vases, trinkets and tusks into an industrial rock crusher that ground the tchotchkes to dust.

Authorities say Sakhaiâ€™s shop was raided after an undercover officer with the stateâ€™s Department of Environmental Conservation received a tip and purchased an item made from illegal ivory in July.

Experts at the American Museum of Natural History, where the item was brought for morphological analysis, confirmed that the piece was carved from authentic elephant ivory.

""Our ECOs are dedicated to cracking down on the illegal market for ivory and bringing an end to the senseless slaughtering of the world's elephants,"" Basil Seggos, commissioner of the state conservation department, said in a statement. ""This sends a clear message that we will not allow this trade to continue in New York. I commend the work of New York County District Attorney Cyrus Vance and his staff for their swift actions in prosecuting this immoral criminal activity.â€

Sakhai and his business were each charged with two counts of Illegal Commercialization of Fish, Shellfish, Crustaceans and Wildlife, a class E felony, and two counts Illegal Commercialization of Fish, Shellfish, Crustaceans and Wildlife, a class D felony.

While Sakhai pleaded guilty to the violation of Illegal Commercialization of Wildlife, his business pleaded guilty to the E felony of illegal Commercialization of Elephant Ivory.

The deal requires Alexander's Antiques to donate $60,000 toward the Wildlife Conservation Societyâ€™s fight against elephant poaching in Africa, and to forfeit more than 100 ivory articles to New York state.

The Special Task Force (STF) of the Crime Branch on Friday [12/02/2021] arrested three miscreants from Jajpur district for wildlife trafficking and seized three elephant tusks from them. On a tip-off, the sleuths raided Kabatabandha Square near Brahmani bridge and apprehended Pitabas Barik and Ananda Mahakud of Keonjhar district along with Ambuja Pradhan of Jajpur. ""A case has been registered under Sections 379 and 411 of IPC and Section 51 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act.

Barik, Mahakud and Pradhan were produced before JMFC court in Chandikhol later in the day. The accused will be brought on remand to verify where the elephants were killed and their links with other criminals. Sources said India does not have a huge market for elephant tusks. Suspecting that the tusks are being smuggled to other countries, STF officers are verifying possible links of the wildlife criminals nabbed in the last six days with local and international smuggling rackets. The sleuths had received an information about a planned wildlife deal after which they conducted a surprise raid near Keonjhar RTO on February 7 and apprehended Sheikh Hasmati Ali and Chandrakant Dhal of Karanjia along with Malaya Kumar Rout of Keonjhar district's Janghira. STF officers requested the court to grant them a seven-day police remand of two accused including Ali but they were allowed three-day remand for questioning the duo. Sources said the STF, DFOs of Mayurbhanj and Keonjhar are questioning Ali and another accused whose police remand started on Thursday. Ali allegedly has links with some wildlife criminals in Kolkata as well as in Nepal. Police suspect that the elephant was probably killed in Mayurbhanj or Keonjhar and efforts are being made to ascertain all the links of the illegal trade.

Agents of the National Police have intervened in Madrid 49 specimens of naturalized animals, some included within those that are of special protection in the International Agreement on Protected Species, as well as four elephant tusks, four hippopotamus tusks and two rhinoceros horns and 132 pieces of ivory. In the operation, which has been carried out in collaboration with the Madrid Municipal Police and the CITES Service (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), there is a man investigated for a continued crime of trafficking in species protected. All the specimens were exposed in two pavilions located in the farm where the address of the investigated is located, in Madrid. In the registry carried out in the same, the agents intervened 49 specimens of naturalized animals, such as bears, lynxes, leopards, wolves, crocodiles and primates. In addition, four elephant tusks, four hippopotamus tusks and two rhinoceros horns were seized, as well as 132 figures carved from elephant ivory. All the pieces were sealed and remained as a deposit in their place of exhibition, due to their high fragility. The investigation began in November 2019 when two agents from the Madrid Municipal Police Corps became aware of the existence of a collection of naturalized animals of various species --some of them apparently protected by the CITES Convention-- whose owner had the intention to give to a museum in a municipality of Badajoz. The Environmental Group of the National Police initiated the steps in order to prove the possible commission of a continued crime against flora and fauna or even one of smuggling. As a first measure, the researchers contacted the CITES administrative authority to determine if among the game pieces there could be any included among the species of special protection. This extreme was confirmed by said authority who determined that a high number of protected species was observed according to the different CITES Appendices and Regulation 338/97 of the European Union Commission. Likewise, it indicated that the investigated lacked many of the mandatory permits and certificates for its possession and importation into national territory. For a year, the person under investigation provided documentation with the aim of proving the lawful origin of the items seized, alleging that many copies were acquired prior to the date of entry into force of the CITES Convention in Spain. In the case of those specimens for which no valid documentation has been presented, on October 14 they were removed, subject to judicial authorization, and transferred to warehouses authorized by the National Museum of Natural Sciences and the administrative authority.

Another man has been arrested for illegal ivory dealing, being found trying to sell 21 pieces of ivory from his house in Gutu. Collin Tapfumaneyi Chizengeni (57) was arrested on Sunday, with a sack of ivory at his house in Munhende Location, while looking for buyers, national police spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said yesterday. The latest arrest comes after police recently arrested five suspected poachers in Hwangeand recovered two rifles, including an AK47 assault rifle and over 60 rounds of ammunition, plus four elephant tusks, with an estimated weight of 13kg, and a fresh elephant tail and five jungle knives. Amos Mudenda (65), Patrick Mudenda (67), Liason Mudimba (49), Edwin Munsaka (32), and Lizwe Munenge (42) were charged with possession of raw unmarked ivory without a permit. Acting on a tip off, detectives pounced on the suspects who were searching for elephant tusk buyers in the Kamativi area, leading to their arrest. â€œThe suspects were searched and four elephant tusks, with an estimated weight of 13kg, a fresh elephant tail, an AK47 with a magazine of 26 rounds and 29 AK47 loose rounds, a 375 rifle loaded with nine rounds, five 375 rifle loose rounds, four axes, and five jungle knives were recovered,â€ Asst Comm Nyathi said. In March, a suspected poacher was shot and killed at Malilangwe Conservancy Trust in Chiredzi during a gunfight with game scouts, while his two accomplices escaped. The three were spotted in the conservancy by the anti-poaching team, which confronted them, but they tried to escape by firing at the team, resulting in the exchange of gun fire as the game scouts fired back. Police recovered a CZ550 rifle loaded with one round in the chamber, two spent cartridges, seven spent cartridges of an MK3 rifle, a satchel bag containing a small iron axe and a flick knife. Police recently unearthed a black rhinoceros poaching syndicate that was moving around targeting the animals and de-horning them. The rhino is targeted for its horn, which sells for tens of thousands of US dollars in the underground, illegal wildlife markets.

Four suspects were on Thursday charged at Voi Law Courts with illegal possession of assorted wildlife trophies including sandalwood and elephants tusks. In the first count, Kasungwa Mulu, Jacob Shangala, Solomon Mwaluma and Tangai Mwasi were charged with being in possession of 13 sacks of sandalwood that weighed 287 kilograms. The four were intercepted on Wednesday afternoon by Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) officers at Manga area in Voi sub-county with the illicit cargo. Three of the suspects namely Kasungwa Mulu, Jacob Shangala and Solomon Mwaluma faced an additional count of being in possession of five pieces of elephant tusks weighing 10.6kgs. Appearing before Voi Chief Magistrate Mildred Obura, the four suspects pleaded not guilty. Each of the suspects was released on a bond of Sh100,000 with a surety of the similar amount or a cash bail of Sh50,000 for each count. The mention will be on January 25, 2022. Taita Taveta being host to Tsavo National Park has been a poaching hotspot owing to the parkâ€™s vast size and terrain. KWS officers have been collaborating with local communities and other stakeholders to eradicate all forms of wildlife crime, particularly poaching. Though poaching and wildlife trafficking activities have significantly reduced, the illegal trade in wildlife products such as game meat and tree poaching still remains to be a worrying global threat. Despite this challenge, wildlife conservationists and the governmentâ€™s stance on poaching and wildlife conservation has been consistently no-nonsense.

Four suspected poachers were on Thursday charged at Voi law courts with illegal possession of five pieces of elephantsâ€™ tusks weighing 10.6kgs. The four were also charged with being in possession of 13 sacks of sandalwood that weighed 287kgs. They were nabbed by Kenya Wildlife Service officers on Wednesday at Manga in Voi, Taita Taveta county. The suspects had stashed the illegal consignment in sacks of polythene bags and were being transported to the market. Kasungwa Mulu, Jacob Shangala, Solomon Mwaluma and Tangai Mwasi however denied the charges before Voi chief magistrate Mildred Obura. They were released on a bond of Sh100,000 with a surety of a similar amount or a cash bail of Sh50,000 for each count. The case is slated for mentioning on January 25. Cases of poaching have been a thorny issue in Tsavo National Park with bushmeat poaching being on the rise. Stakeholders in the county are set to establish a wildlife security hub that will help combat human-wildlife conflict, illegal trafficking and poaching through an integrated approach. The two state of the art centers will be located at the KWS Voi office and Kasigau wildlife corridor. The hubs will provide a coordinated and multi-agency approach to deal with poaching and perennial human-wildlife conflict in the region. The Tsavo National Park is rich in biodiversity and contains both animals and plants of high ecological value. It is Kenyaâ€™s largest national park. Wildlife insecurity in Kenya is characterised by poaching, illicit wildlife trade, commercial poaching for bushmeat and destruction of habitats. The KWS data has placed Taita Taveta county as a poaching hotspot. There have been frequent seizures of illegal bushmeat over the last six years, mostly from dik diks and eland- the worldâ€™s largest antelope.

Four persons who were found to be selling parts ofÂ protected animal species and their skins have been arrested in Oyem, capital of Woleu-Ntem province in northernÂ Gabon. They were arrested on Saturday, April 16, by the elements of the provincial service of judicial police in Oyem. The operation was carried out by judicial police assisted by elements of the Ministry of Water and Forests with the support of members of the environmental protection Non-governmental Organisation (NGO), Conservation Justice. All the four persons arrested are Gabonese and had in their possession four elephant tusks, an elephant tail, three skins and five panther teeth. This constitutes an offence contrary to Article 579 of the Gabonese penal code and Article 92 and 275 of the forestry code. It is also against Article 3 of the biodiversity and ecosystems preservation principle adopted by Law Number 0002/2014 on the sustainable development of the Republic of Gabon. The four traffickers were arrested in the middle of a sales transaction. One of them, who was only identified as A.N.G. was the owner of the two skins and five panther teeth.Â When his house was searched, 20 ammunition were found and further investigations led to the arrest of the other members of the network of illicit traffickers. Another member of the network identified as N.N.C. is a retiree who shot the elephant and cut off the tail and removed the tusks. A search conducted in his house in Nkout village found ammunition.Â The accused took the security team to the scene where the elephant was shot and the skeleton of the animal was found there.  Another of the suspects, who is a teacher and identified as A.J.B. was the owner of two elephant tusks which he said he found in the forest. A search conducted in his house found no further evidence. The four risk up to 10 years imprisonment, according to the Gabonese penal code. A senior official in the countryâ€™s Ministry of Water and Forestry told HumAngle that the protection of wildlife species and the forest constitute aspects of the sustainable tourism perspective of Gabon which is a â€œgreen powerâ€ on the international scene.

118213,"DINDIGUL: In a two-day undercover operation, the forest department personnel in Tamil Nadu's Kodaikanal, along with the protection and vigilance wing from Chennai, arrested nine persons and seized two small tusks that they tried to sell to prospective buyers. The pair of tusks measured 52 cm each in length, 15 cm circumference and weighed 1.89 kg (0.97 and 0.92 kg, respectively). Preliminary inquiry revealed that the small tusks belonged to a sub-adult elephant and that it could have been retrieved from the carcass at least a decade ago. The tusks reached the arrested persons after being passed on to various persons over the years. The tusks will be sent to the Advanced Institute of Wildlife Conservation (AIWC), Chennai for analysis. District forest officer (DFO) for Kodaikanal forest division, PK Philip, said that the operation was conducted based on a tip-off received by the principal chief wildlife warden. â€œPosing as prospective buyers, our team began the operation in the early hours of Saturday and nabbed them on Sunday morning,â€ he toldÂ TOI. It was decided that the sellers would show the tusks in their possession to the prospective buyers near a Tasmac outlet at Devadhanapatti on the Periyakulam to Batlagundu road in the early hours of Sunday for the buyers to check if the tusks were original or fake ones before they could decide on buying it. One of the accused Chinnaraj (29) brought the two tusks in a travel bag while the nine others were with him when the forest department team surrounded and nabbed them. While nine of them were arrested, search is on for R Suresh of Devadhanapatti in Theni who managed to escape on a two-wheeler.

Isaac Mugwandia Macharia was arrested on Thursday morning in a joint operation by DCI special service unit team and Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) officers, who were acting on intelligence. The team said they recovered a G3 rifle magazine, five bullets, bow and arrows and one ivory from his house. The team also recovered assorted Sim cards, laptops, cell phones and storage devices. A process data quickly machine that police suspect could be used in fraud was also recovered from the house. Macharia was expected before Kamiti law courts to face cybercrime charges and a wildlife trafficking offence. Police spokesman Bruno Shioso said the arrest is a major breakthrough in cracking organized crime in the city. â€œWe are looking for more suspects,â€ he said. He said the suspect is part of a five-member gang being sought after by the police. The five individuals include Ian James and a Congolese national Luodom Serge. James was arrested in December 2021 while in possession of narcotics and wildlife trophies. Poaching in the region is on the rise as armed criminal gangs kill elephants for tusks and rhinos for horns, which are usually shipped to Asia. As part of efforts to stop the crime, Kenya has started using high-tech surveillance equipment, including drones to track poaching gangs and keep tabs on elephants and rhinos. Parliament has also passed strict anti-poaching laws, and the government has beefed up security at parks to stop poaching, which threatens the vital tourism industry.  Kenya has special squads pursuing poachers. Regionally, Kenya has also emerged as a major transit route for ivory destined for Asian markets from eastern and central Africa. The illegal ivory trade is mostly fuelled by demand in Asia and the Middle East, where elephant tusks and rhinoceros horns are used to make ornaments and traditional medicines.

A ZIMBABWE Parks ranger at Sinamatela Camp in Hwange National Park and a police officer stationed at the Police Support Unit barracks at Chikurubi in Harare were arrested along with another man after they were allegedly caught selling elephant tusks in Greendale. Simibio Kakomo and Shepherd Musiniwa were taken to the Harare Magistrates Court where they jointly appeared with Enerst Kabanda charged with unlawful possession of elephant tusks. They were not asked to plead to the charges when they appeared before magistrate Mrs Barbra Mateko, who remanded them in custody to April 20 and told them that only the High Court could grant them bail. Mr Thomas Chanakira for the State said on Monday at around 7:45am, detectives from CID Minerals, Fauna and Flora Unit Harare were told that the three were selling ivory at Total Service Station along Julius Nyerere Way. They then pretended to be potential buyers before laying a trap. The detectives met Kabanda who told them to go Kamfinsa shopping centre in Greendale where Kakomo and Musiniwa were waiting with the ivory. Kamfinsa is along Arturus Road on the way to Chikurubi. When the detectives and Kabanda arrived at Kamfinsa, Kabanda allegedly contacted Kakomo, who came in the company of Musiniwa to meet the potential buyers. They agreed to sell the ivory for US$50 a kilogramme. After reaching an agreement, Kakomo and Musiniwa went to a building and brought a greenish sleeping bag which contained the ivory. The detectives then recovered eight pieces of ivory weighing 28,35kg valued at US$4,819.50, equivalent to $703,574.

PALERMO â€“ Four tusks of raw, unworked ivory were seized by the forest police of the nature anti-crime center of Palermo in a hotel in Palermo. The tusks, together with other artifacts always obtained from elephant parts, were exhibited to the public in the premises of the structure intended to host private events and were one of the attractions, so much so that they were often immortalized by patrons and posted on social networks. The Carabinieri of the Cites Nucleus are in action. The specialized military of the Cites Nucleus carried out an administrative check to verify if the owners of the structure had certificates and authorizations to keep the tusks. To date, no documents have been provided. For this crime, the penalty is imprisonment from 6 months to 2 years and a fine from 15 thousand to 150 thousand euros. In fact, ivory is subject to the protections provided for by the Washington Convention which governs the international trade in species of wild fauna and flora threatened with extinction, whose commercial exploitation (but also only possession) without the appropriate certificates constitutes a hypothesis of crime. The discovery is of particular relevance both for the size of the tusks, each more than two meters high and about 20 kilos in weight, and for the fact that they are unprocessed tusks, whose discipline is even more restrictive than that relating to worked ivory.

Ali said authorities had arrested three foreign nationals and were pursuing a fourth, whom he described as the kingpin of the operation. ""The suspects arrested will soon have their date in court as NCS will leave no stone unturned to bring them to justice,"" Ali said. Nigeria has become a hub for gangs sending African pangolins to Asia, according to law enforcement officials and wildlife experts. They blame insecure borders, lax law enforcement, corruption and access to large ports. Ali said customs was working with British, U.S. and German officials as well as international organizations to step up counter-smuggling operations. That ""extensive collaboration"" led to the seizure from Lekki, near Nigeria's main ports in Lagos The pangolin, a shy, critically endangered animal, has become one of the most trafficked mammals on earth due to demand for its scales in traditional Chinese medicine.

Some three tons of African ivory sat in an unmarked crate in a Cambodian port for more than a year, until a tip from the U.S. embassy led authorities to break it open this week and discover the country's largest-ever haul of trafficked ivory. Port laborers who recently gathered outside the facility told a reporter that no one had ever showed up to claim the valuable cargo. ""There are 12 containers and one container consists of elephants tusks packed in sacks and some sacks loading rocks which look like marble,"" said a laborer who witnessed the seizure at the Phnom Penh Autonomous Port Container Terminal on Thursday last week. Emily Zeeberg, the U.S. Embassy spokesperson, said American officials provided information to the Cambodian Customs and Excise Department that ultimately led to the search of a sealed container and to the seizure of 1,026 cut and whole pieces of ivory weighing approximately 3,370 kilograms. ""The ivory originated from Mozambique. Cambodia is a transit hub; there is no information indicating that the ivory was intended to be sold here in Cambodia,"" she said in an email. ""The investigation is ongoing."" Ros Vanna, chairman and CEO of Kampuchea Shipping Agency and Brokers, also known as Kamsab, which grants customs clearance to foreign ships, said the port does not have rights to open the sealed containers immediately if the owner does not come. He said if goods are abandoned, a court must intervene. Sun Chhay, a director of the Customs and Excise Office at the port, told VOA Khmer that the owner of the containers apparently did not show up to claim the cargo because they feared the smuggling operation had been exposed. Chhay confirmed that the ivory was imported from Mozambique and shipped through Vietnam, where he said it was not checked because that country's customs authority does not have the rights to check transiting cargo.

There was panic and fear at J- Smart guest house in Nansana West zone B, when police on Saturday night stormed the place to arrest one of their own, PC Patrick Katushabe, who was allegedly selling illegally obtained ivory. Since the operation was conducted at a quarter to 8 pm, many people had already booked rooms to rest, but the police raid caused panic and fears as clients reportedly wondered what had happened. Police officers who conducted the operation and witnesses intimate that some people attempted to flee but they were calmed down by being assured that the operation was only targeting illegal wildlife species dealers. â€œSome people were only in towels and others remained with their partners, peeping through the windows,â€ a police source said. â€œWe saw some trying to flee but they were told that the operation wasnâ€™t about them. Although it did not take many minutes, it left clients in shock,â€ an informant said. URN understands that Constable Katushabe was arrested alongside Dan Ayesiga after Uganda Wildlife Authority â€“ UWA learnt that the duo had traveled from Hoima district in search of prospective buyers in Kampala. It is reported that Katushabe and Ayesiga started making calls to buyers when they were still in Hoima and UWA investigators disguised as interested buyers started engaging them. The false buyers kept demanding for details of where they could meet for the deal to be swiftly done. It was then that the unsuspecting duo revealed the place where they had booked for the transaction to be accomplished. Armed with details of the booked accommodation, UWA tipped Nansana police station. a Detective Assistant Inspector of Police â€“D/AIP was assigned to spearhead the operation which led to the arrest of Constable Katushabe and his colleague Ayesiga red-handed with 14 pieces of ivory. Before heading out to effect the arrest, the D/AIP registered the case as SD 52/05/11/2022. Even at the time of raiding J-Smart guest house, the suspects were in communication with UWA officers who were promising that they had come with all the money needed for 14 tusks. â€œReaching Nansana west, the suspects were in communication with the team of wildlife officers who were luring them with the cash offer. The Suspects later were arrested in one of the Nansana guest houses known as J-smart and the exhibits were recovered in the same guest house. The two Suspects are detained at Nansana police station booked under SD 73/05/11/2022 for being in possession of wildlife species,â€ the D/AIP Ggiach states in the report sent to Kampala Metropolitan Police headquarters. Patrick Onyango, the Kampala KMP spokesperson, said he was yet to get details of the operations and exhibits recovered. But sources have said that Nansana police will deliver the exhibits to CID headquarters in Kibuli by close of business on Sunday. â€œConstable Katushabe has told us that he is from the ICT department of Jinja police while Ayesiga has said he is a driver from Hoima district,â€ a police source said. â€œThese two came driving in a Toyota Wish UBM 662K and the 14 ivory pieces were in the boot.â€ Constable Katushabe and Ayesiga will be arraigned in the utilities court at Buganda road where they will face charges of being in possession of wildlife species.

A specialized team to combat trafficking in protected species and illegal wildlife trade is destabilizing a group of wildlife traffickers operating in the town of Mouila. Indeed, following a recent operation in the city of Lastourville, two new interventions coordinated by a mixed team composed of agents of the Mouila branch of the Judicial Police and those of the Provincial Directorate of Water and Forests, supported by the NGO Conservation Justice have just neutralized an alleged wildlife trafficker and two of his alleged accomplices. Two days after a similar operation in Lastourville that resulted in the arrest of an alleged trafficker, his two accomplices and the escape of a third repeat accomplice, another mixed team formed in the province of NgouniÃ© deployed to the city of Mouila and LÃ©bamba to carry out a joint mission to combat wildlife trafficking. This mission will give rise to two interventions that will allow the successive arrest of an entrepreneur in Mouila and two of his accomplices in LÃ©bamba. In Mouila, the entrepreneur, who would be the broker of the group, was first arrested when He was preparing to conclude a transaction for the sale of six (6) ivory points in total, including 4 cut into eight (8) pieces. The continuation of the investigations will lead the agents of the mixed team on the trail of the one who would be the owner of the ivory points. He was arrested in LÃ©bamba with another member of the group a few hours later. Back in Mouila and at the time of the search at the camp of the third member of the group arrested in LÃ©bamba, the officers will discover and seize a hunting equipment including two (2) 12-gauge weapons and several large-scale hunting ammunition (458 caliber). According to information gathered from a source close to the case, the owner of the ivories would be known to the judicial police services for having been arrested and convicted for the same facts in May 2017. The three members of the group were taken into custody at the judicial police station in Mouila pending their transfer to Libreville before being presented to the special prosecutor's office. The alleged traffickers will have to answer for the facts of possession and attempted marketing of ivory. They face up to ten years in prison in accordance with the provisions of Article 388 of the Penal Code. The cases of recidivism that have emerged in these two operations challenge the actors involved in the application of wildlife legislation on the treatment of criminal sanctions imposed on ivory traffickers who continue to act after a first conviction. Three years after the strengthening of the criminal policy instituting ivory trafficking as an act of environmental crime in Gabon, these cases should know the sad application of the provisions of Article 388 to guarantee the maintenance of biodiversity, a tourism potential on which Gabon relies in its strategy of plan to accelerate the transformation planned by the government.

A Ugandan court has sentenced an ivory trader to life in prison - the longest sentence for such crimes in the country's history. A new law was passed in 2019 that toughened sentences for poaching or trafficking in endangered species. Pascal Ochiba was arrested in January this year with two pieces of ivory, weighing nearly 10kg (22lb). The magistrate said Ochiba, as a repeat offender, deserved life in prison for the future protection of wildlife. In passing sentence, the chief magistrate of the country's special wildlife court, Gladys Kamasanyu, said ""offences of unlawful possession of protected species are rampant and there is need to curb them"", according to a statement from the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA). ""This is a landmark achievement in our war on illegal wildlife trade in Uganda. We must do our best in our times to protect our wildlife otherwise history will judge us harshly,"" UWA Executive Director Sam Mwandha said. In 2020, the hunter who killed a silverback gorilla known as Rafiki received an 11-year sentence. In September this year, two men were each sentenced to eight years in jail for killing six rare tree-climbing lions. There are just over 7,900 elephants left in the wild in Uganda - these include both forest and savannah elephants. Forest elephants are categorised as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and savannah elephants are listed as endangered. The country's elephant population has been growing since the 1990s. The mammals still however face threats from poaching and trafficking. Ochiba had been sent to prison once before - in 2017 - after he was arrested with four pieces of ivory and the skin of an Okapi. Okapi are rare, zebra-like forest animals endemic only to neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo.

2022-09-20 (Hearing): Todayâ€™s testimony was from P.C. Ahmed Mukhtar of the National Police Service, who was one of the officers at the arrest.  In the course of his testimony, he contradicted previous evidence of KWS officers and the contents of his original written statement regarding the location of the recovered ivory and the number of suspects at the arrest. During the testimony, Mombasa magistrate Martin Rabera, on several occasions had to interject, ordering P.C. Mukhtar to refrain from reading from written notes. Prosecutor Anne Nyawira subsequently had to make an application requesting the court to rely on the witnessâ€™s earlier written statement as evidence in chief. The accusedâ€™s advocate opposed the application, stating that the reason for the contradictory evidence was that his client was never arrested in possession of ivory and had been framed. Magistrate Rabera will make a ruling on the prosecutionâ€™s application on September 27th [2022].

Malaysia has made its biggest ivory seizure to date, confiscating six tonnes of elephant tusks hidden in a container that also carried rhino horns, pangolin scales and the skulls, bones and parts of other wildlife. The shipment, which originated in an unnamed country in Africa, was seized on 10 July 2022 after it transited through Abu Dhabi, UAE. The shipment was destined for the southern Malaysian port of Pasir Gudang, but was intercepted by authorities in West Port in Port Kelang. The ship carrying the contraband had been under surveillance by Malaysian Customs, Dato Haji Zazuli Johan, the Director-General of the Royal Malaysian Customs told a press conference which TRAFFIC attended. The items seized included 6,000kg of elephant ivory, 29 kg of rhino horn (14 horns and pieces), around 100kg of pangolin scales and more than 300 kg of other wildlife parts. The shipment consisted of three containers, one of which hid the multitude of wildlife parts behind sawn timber. The other two containers were full of the same timber, which is commonly used by traffickers to hide African ivory and pangolin scales. The legality of the timber has yet to be verified. The importer of the consignment and the shipping agent are under investigation. No arrests have been made.

The Royal Malaysian Customs Department (JKDM) has foiled a syndicateâ€™s attempt to smuggle wildlife parts, including elephant tusks, rhinoceros horns, pangolin scales and tiger fangs worth RM80 million hidden behind a pile of sawn timber in a container. Customs director-general Datuk Zazuli Johan said the container was seized at West Port, Port Klang on July 10, making it the biggest seizure involving wildlife parts. He added that previously, JKDM scored a big success when they seized pangolin scales and elephant tusks worth RM40 million and RM2.4 million, respectively in 2012. â€œThe container, believed from an African country, was supposed to dock at Pasir Gudang Port, Johor, to be transferred to another ship. But, we received information on the smuggling and intercepted the container at West Port,â€ he said at a press conference today. Physical checks on the container found elephant tusks, weighing about 6,000 kilogrammes (kg), 29 kg of rhinoceros horns, 100 kg of pangolin scales, 14 kg of wildlife horns, as well as, 300 kg of animal skulls and bones hidden behind stacked sawn timber, he added. Zazuli said JKDM believed Malaysia is a transit before the goods are brought to other countries to be marketed. He added that wildlife part imports are banned under the Third Schedule of the International Trade in Endangered Species Act 2008 (Act 686), except with permits issued by the Department of Wildlife and National Parks. Zazuli, however, said no arrests were made so far, and investigations on the importer and shipping agents are ongoing. He added that the case is being investigated under Section 135 (1)(a) of the Customs Act 1967 for trying to smuggle illegal or duty unpaid goods via Malaysian ports.

Malaysian authorities have seized a container of African elephant tusks, pangolin scales and other wildlife skulls and bones estimated to be worth 80 million Malaysian ringgit ($18m) â€“ their biggest seizure to date. The Royal Malaysian Customs Department said in a statement on Monday that it had discovered the contraband hidden behind sawn timber following checks on a ship on July 10. The haul included 6,000kg (13,227 pounds) of elephant tusks, 100kg (220 pounds) of pangolin scales, 25kg (55 pounds) of rhino horns and 300kg (661 pounds) of animal parts including bones and horns, it added. Royal Malaysian Customs Director General, Zazuli Johan, told reporters at a news conference in Port Klang, Malaysiaâ€™s main port, that it was their biggest seizure to date. The shipment had been on its way from Africa via Abu Dhabi to Pasir Gudang, a major port in southern Malaysia, and was under surveillance. He said: â€œThe customs enforcement unit successfully thwarted an attempted smuggling of these items â€“ elephant tusks, rhino horns, pangolin scales, tiger teeth and various other bones and animal parts that were found in a container at Port Klang.â€ The customs department said investigations were ongoing. Officials did not give further details and it was unclear if the container was meant to be shipped to other parts of Asia. â€œThis medley of threatened species in a single consignment is concerning,â€ Kanitha Krishnasamy, director for TRAFFIC Southeast Asia, said in a statement. â€œIt certainly verifies the suspicion that criminals continue to use Malaysian ports to move contraband wildlife.â€ Trade in the worldâ€™s eight species of the pangolin is completely banned under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Still, demand for the animalâ€™s scales, which, like human nails, are made of keratin, is feeding the illegal trade. The pangolin is said to be the worldâ€™s most trafficked mammal. Ivory tusks, rhino horns and pangolin scales are believed to have medicinal properties by some people, and are in high demand in the region.

Malaysian authorities have seized a massive haul of trafficked animal parts, including elephant tusks, rhino horns, pangolin scales and tiger bones worth around 80 million ringgit ($17.9 million). Authorities discovered around six tonnes of ivory tusks and other animal parts at the western port in Selangor state on Sunday. The animal parts are thought to have been shipped from Africa, Malaysian Customs Director General Zazuli Johan said on Monday. Malaysian customs shared photos showing a pile of tusks and other animal parts including an animal skull and jewelry that appears to be made of ivory. Malaysia is one of several Southeast Asian countries identified by conservationists as a major transit point for illegally trafficked endangered wildlife that is en route to other Asian countries, mostly China. Many of these animal parts, such as lion bones, are used for traditional medicines. Pangolins, which are scale-covered insectivores about the size of a house cat, are highly valued for their meat and scales, considered a delicacy and valuable in traditional medicine â€“ and have been hunted to their limits. In 2020, the Chinese government removed pangolin scales from its list of approved ingredients used in traditional Chinese medicine, a move campaigners described as a critical step toward saving the worldâ€™s most trafficked mammal.

In recent years, Nigeria has evolved into a primary transit hub for trafficking in illicit wildlife products, including pangolin scales, ivory and other protected species from Eastern and Central Africa, arriving in the country through its porous borders, as indicated in the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimeâ€™s (UNODC) World Wildlife Crime Report 2020.Nigerian authorities have stepped up enforcement actions against illicit trafficking of wildlife and forestry products. The Nigerian minister of environment, Mohammed Abdullahi, said the country is up-scaling its moves in combating wildlife and forest crimes citing the launch of the National Strategy Plan on Combating Illegal Wildlife and Forest Crime in Nigeria. Several large-scale seizures of wildlife and forest products took place in 2021. On 2 February 2022, the Nigeria Customs Service reported yet another seizure of 14 sacks containing 839.40kgs of pangolin scales and 4 sacks containing 40 pieces of cut ivory weighing 145kgs.

Six tonnes of smuggled ivory tusks and pangolin scales have been discovered in a container at Tien Sa Port in the central city of Da Nang. Customs officials in collaboration with relevant forces on January 11 decided to inspect what had been declared as cashew nut imported from Nigeria based on suspicious signs about the goods, resulting in the finding. The smuggled goods, including 456 kg of ivory and 6.2 tonnes of pangolin scales, were on the list of goods banned from trading under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The case is under further investigation. In July last year, more than 3.2 tonnes of rhino horns and bones of rare animals were found in containers at Da Nang Port. In March 2019, customs officials in Da Nang also seized 9.1 tonnes of smuggled ivory tusks.

More than 6.6 metric tons of suspected ivory and pangolin scales were seized by customs officers from a suspicious container recently shipped from Nigeria to Tien Sa Port in Da Nang, Vietnam. The customs declaration claimed its contents to be cashew nuts, but upon opening the container, officers found suspected endangered animal parts, including 456 kilograms of ivory and around 6.2 metric tons of pangolin scales, local customs officials reported on Thursday. The discovery was made during an inspection on Tuesday after customs officers at the port declared the container, which arrived at Tien Sa on January 5, as â€˜suspicious.â€™ The Da Nang customs, in conjunction with other relevant agencies, have launched an investigation into the alleged smuggling. They are currently tracking the enterprises and individuals responsible for the container. Those involved in the case will be prosecuted, radio station Voice of Vietnam cited Tran Van Anh, deputy detector of the Da Nang Customs Department. Endangered wildlife products are strictly banned from being traded in, imported to or exported from Vietnam as they are protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), to which the country has been party since 1994. Several cases of smuggling wildlife products have been detected at Tien Sa Port in recent years, all shipped from Africa. In October 2018, local customs officers found some six metric tons of pangolin scales and around two metric tons of tusks stashed among recycled plastics in a container also consigned from Nigeria. In March 2019, more than 9.1 metric tons of ivory was discovered in a shipment delivered from the Congo, with the tusks hidden among timber. In July 2021, a shipment declared as wood but containing 138 kilograms of rhino horn and around 3.1 metric tons of wildlife bones arrived at the port from South Africa.

[25,751.2 USD as of 29/04/2021]. Mr Gideon Kebati, the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) senior warden at the park said they pursued the suspects after a tip off by members of public at Kathithine area in Tharaka North sub county where they were arrested. â€œOur officers have been working on this information and finally caught up with them in the area known to be a hotspot for poaching. The undercover officers arrested them while in possession of the tusks,â€ said Mr Kebati. The suspects, who Mr Kebati said were being processed and will be arraigned in court as soon as investigations are complete, are Nicholas Kibara from Kathithine and Julius cMusili Mutemi from Mpeketoni area in Igembe North, Meru County. The suspects told investigators that they transported the tusks from Lower Imenti forest last week after being instructed by a convict, Mr Josephat Muthengi who is serving a five year jail term. Mr Muthengi was jailed by a court in Marimanti, Tharaka-Nithi county early this year [2021] after being found guilty of dealing in ivory. â€œBefore he was jailed he had buried the tusks in the forest. During one of the visits at the prison by the suspects, the convict gave them instructions on where to retrieve the ivory and even made arrangements with a boda boda operator who would ferry the tusks,â€ Mr Kebati said. It was during the transportation that a member of the public got suspicious of the load and informed the police, the officer added. Before being jailed, Mr Muthengi was believed to have coordinated poaching activities in the area. â€œThe prisoner is the mastermind of the deal and the fact that he can coordinate such an activity means he still has a network. We are on top of things and we will ensure we get those behind the criminal network,â€ Mr Kebati said â€œWe will also hold talks with the prison commander with a view to establish what other links he has,â€ he added.

Four suspects were on Saturday arrested while trying to sell ten pieces of elephant tusks weighing 28 kilograms in Busia Town. The four were riding on a bodaboda when they were intercepted by police and Kenya Wildlife Service officials who had been tipped off. Upon searching two gunny bags they were ferrying with ten pieces of elephant tusks weighing 28 kilogrames with an estimated street value of Sh2.8 million were recovered, police said. The two men and two women said they were taking the same to a potential buyer when they were intercepted on July 29. The buyer happened to be an undercover detective who had been tipped off about the deal. Police say they are yet to know the source of the tusks. The suspects were Monday, July 31 expected in court as police investigate the source of the tusks. Elephant tusks fetch a fortune in the black market as a surge in demand for ivory in the East continues to fuel the illicit trade in elephant tusks, especially from Africa. Officials say despite a ban on the international trade in ivory, African elephants are still being poached in large numbers. As part of efforts to stop the menace, Kenya has started using high-tech surveillance equipment, including drones, to track poachers and keep tabs on elephants and rhinos. KWS and stakeholders have put in place mechanisms to eradicate all forms of wildlife crime, particularly poaching. hese mechanisms include enhanced community education, interagency collaboration, and intensive intelligence-led operations, among others. These efforts led to zero rhino poaching in Kenya in 2020-the first time in about two decades. At least 20,000 elephants are killed annually in Africa for their ivory. This translates to 55 elephants killed daily or one elephant killed every 26 minutes with a population of 35,000 elephants. On April 30, 2016, Kenya set ablaze 105 tonnes of elephant ivory and 1.35 tonnes of rhino horn. Former President Uhuru Kenyatta led world leaders and conservationists in burning the remains of 6,500 elephants and 450 rhinos killed for their tusks and horn. Parliament has also passed strict anti-poaching laws and the government has beefed up security at parks to stop poaching, which threatens the vital tourism industry. Regionally, Kenya has also emerged as a major transit route for ivory destined for Asian markets from eastern and central Africa. The illegal ivory trade is mostly fuelled by demand in Asia and the Middle East, where elephant tusks and rhino horns are used to make ornaments and traditional medicines.

According to the STF, the personnel received an intelligence input from the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, Northern Region, regarding the ivory smuggling gang. â€œWorking on the input, the Noida field unit of STF received information on Thursday evening that the suspects are coming to sell ivory in the Bisrakh area of Greater Noida. Acting on this, an STF team along with personnel from the local Bisarkh police station reached the spot in Chipiyana village mentioned by the informer,â€ it said. The team saw two people standing next to a maroon Honda city and one of them had a laptop bag with him as specified by the informer. â€œPolice personnel went to the two suspects and asked to open and display the laptop bag. Upon checking, an elephant tusk weighing 1.8 kilos was found in the bag. They were also asked to show papers of the car but were unable to and were immediately taken into custody,â€ said the STF. The two suspects were identified as Ankur Mathur (30), a resident of Crossings Republik, and Rajat Panwar (27), a native of Solan, Himachal Pradesh. â€œUpon interrogation, the suspects revealed that they had come to Greater Noida to finalise a deal to sell the tusk. Panwar revealed that he works as a driver in Solan where he met another taxi driver Arvind. The tusk was given to Arvind by his friend Pooran, a resident of Shimla,â€ stated the official note from STF. It further stated that the tusk was given to Panwar and Arvind by Puran to be sold in NCR, and Arvind asked his old friend Mathur to accompany Panwar on his task. When questioned, Mathur and Panwar did not know where the tusk was procured from. â€œThey said Pooran knew the source of the tusk. An FIR was registered under provisions of Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 and relevant Indian Penal Code sections against Mathur, Panwar, Arvind and Pooran. Efforts are on to find the other associates,â€ said the statement.

109628,"Police and CapeNature's crime unit swooped on a Zimbabwean man attempting to transport ivory from his home country to sell at Cape Town's Greenmarket Square.

Authorities said the incident highlighted the rising danger unsuspecting tourists faced of being arrested for trying to leave the country with ivory, especially with an influx of tourists expected to arrive in the country for the 2010 World Cup.

The bust took place at the beginning of April, following an investigation by the conservation authority and Beaufort West police.

James Chakanetsa was caught with 702 ivory figurines worth an estimated R120 000 at a routine early-morning roadblock in Beaufort West. He was travelling by bus from Zimbabwe.

Paul Gildenhuys, the programme manager for CapeNature's Biodiversity Crime Unit, said Chakanetsa was found guilty of the illegal import and possession of around 50kg of ivory without any documentation.

""The accused has been fined R20 000 or imprisonment for a period of two years, suspended in total for five years at the Beaufort West court at the end of March 2009,"" he said.

Elephants are listed on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, of which South Africa is a signatory.

This means that permits are required internationally for the import or export of any elephant product.

Gildenhuys said the demand for ivory remained high on the international black market and that the prices were determined by the size and condition of the ivory.

He said tourists should be aware of the permit regulations governing the sale of ivory and said the arrest was a ""cause for concern"", considering the goods were heading for Greenmarket Square.

But the city of Cape Town said there had been a noted decrease in illegal ivory trading at Greenmarket Square since they started managing the lease agreements three years ago.

Paul Williamson, the city's service co-ordinator for economic development, said measures were in place to ensure that traders did not break the law.

Apart from the monthly permit applicable to all traders, they would also have to comply with national, provincial and municipal laws.

Traders pay the city R400 a month to lease stalls at Greenmarket Square.

""If the city has absolute proof that traders are not within the law we will take decisive action. We will investigate the matter and, if needs be, cancel the permit immediately.""

Williamson said the city often worked with CapeNature and the police's commercial crimes unit to bring errant traders to book.

South Africa and neighbouring countries such as Zimbabwe had flourishing illegal wild animal markets, according to Gildenhuys.

""In South Africa, particularly, this is compounded by the country's geographical location and relatively sophisticated infrastructure. Poaching is taking place on an increasingly organised scale.""

In May 2017, the suspect appealed his conviction for smuggling the ivory.

Shipping records at the port showed that the two containers had been consigned by a shipping company called Olair Worldwide Logistics.  According to the General Department of Customs, the port authorities were alerted about the containers by the  regional liaison office of the Customs Enforcement Network, a global intelligence service monitoring shipping cargo.

The offenders name is Reho Both (Cambodia), Co., Ltd.  VAT 100188451.

In February 2016, the director of the company, Khan Sinith, was provisionally charged over his alleged role in the seizure.  He was charged with illegally importing goods - ivory - and being involved with contraband, according to Article 98 of the Forestry Law and Article 75 of the Customs Law.

A businessman is appealing his conviction for smuggling more than three tonnes of ivory into Cambodia, the largest haul ever seized.
 

Khan Sinith, the director of an import-export and freight-forwarding company, was sentenced to three years in prison and fined 50 million riel by Preah Sihanouk Provincial Court.
 

He was found guilty of hiding elephant tusks inside a container transporting soy beans, which arrived from Malaysia in 2014 and was destined for a third country.
 

The haul was found after the container was scanned by customs police at Sihanoukville Autonomous Port, who uncovered 108 packages of ivory.
 

The value of the ivory would have run into tens of millions of dollars.
 

Mr Sinith, who is currently on bail while awaiting a hearing at the Court of Appeal, protested his innocence when contacted by the Khmer Times.

The trafficker who is also an imam was found in the middle of a transaction with a lion and leopard skin spread out in his shop.

The Oyo District Court in the Cuvette handed down its verdict on August 6 in the case of a wildlife trafficker, arrested on June 21 in flagrante delicto of illegal possession, circulation and attempted marketing of two ivory tips, weighing in total 20 kg. This is Bonheur Mafimba, a soldier belonging to the Republican Guard stationed in Brazzaville was sentenced to two years in prison, fined 500,000 CFA francs and another 500,000 CFA francs in damages. The slaughter, possession and marketing of trophies of a fully protected animal species (elephant), are the offenses justifying this decision of the district court of this locality. Bonheur Mafimba of Congolese nationality had been arrested in Oyo, in the Cuvette, by the police. Informed, the departmental direction of the forest economy of the Cuvette and the PALF project welcomed this arrest and provided legal support in this case. The ivories in question had been purchased by this wildlife offender from a resident of a village near a protected area before being transported to Oyo. This wildlife trafficker was about to resell them in Oyo, if the security forces had not intervened. The Oyo District Court thus stands out by sending a strong message in the pronunciation of this exemplary and truly dissuasive sentence.

A team of Baikunthapur forest division busted the poaching and animal parts smuggling gang. A forester said IRB constable Ganesh Chhetri was the alleged mastermind of the racket. â€œWe suspect he used his work identity to conceal the crimes,â€ the forester added. According to sources in the forest department, the team was tipped off about an animal parts deal to be struck at a roadside eatery in Odlabari, under Malbazar subdivision of Jalpaiguri, some 40km from here. A team led by Sanjay Dutta, range officer of Sarugarah forest range of Baikunthapur, reached the spot. â€œAround 2am, we spotted the group in front of the eatery. As we challenged them, two fled but the remaining six were caught with a vehicle. We found an elephant task weighing around 1.19 kilos, in their possession,â€ Dutta said. He added that they could not produce any document to prove the legitimacy of the ivory. Those arrested were identified as Gandup Lepcha and Samson Lepcha of Sombarey, Dhan Bahadur Pradhan of east Sikkim, Rohit Tamang of Arithang, Dawa Sherpa of Namchi and Ganesh Chhetri of Upper Kolthang, and produced at the chief judicial magistrateâ€™s court in Jalpaiguri and sent to judicial custody for 14 days, a source said. Foresters came to know that the seized tusk was extracted from a wild elephant poached in Assam. â€œThe arrested persons are habitual poachers and have killed at least 15 wild animals that include elephants, rhinos and even the clouded leopard. They have managed to sell animal parts and made Rs 1.5 crores,â€ said a forester.

Bhawanipatna, Jun 13 (PTI) The putrefied carcass of a full grown female elephant was found in the periphery of Karlapat Wildlife Sanctuary in Odishas Kalahandi district, taking the jumbo death toll in this particular area to nine, officials said. The carcass was sighted in a revenue forest near Karlapat Wildlife Sanctuary by forest workers on Saturday [12/06/2021]. The stunted tusks of the elephant were found to have been removed. With this, nine elephant deaths have been reported during the last four and half months in and around the wildlife sanctuary, they said. The carcass of the female elephant, aged between 30 and 35 years, was recovered from Ranibahal revenue forest within the Silet Gram Panchayat in Thuamul Rampur block under DFO South division, the Divisional Forest Officer (DFO), Kalahandi South Division, T Ashok Kumar, said. Though the area is outside the Karlapat Wildlife Sanctuary area, it is located in its periphery. During the investigation, it was found that one Dana Majhi of Surumundi village was reportedly the main culprit behind the removal of the tusks. Kumar said the tusks were recovered by forest personnel from the house of Dana Majhi at Surumundi village. Though Majhi has escaped to the Muuchkund area of the Rayagada district, the forest department with the help of Rayagada forest staff is looking for him, Kumar said. The remaining elephants of the herd are being monitored by a joint team of Kalahandi South Division and Rayagada Division, he said. A post-mortem examination of the carcass was conducted by veterinary staff and samples of the internal organs were sent to the Centre for Wildlife Health in Cuttack and Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology in Bhubaneswar, for laboratory testing. Veterinary department sources said the death of the elephant is estimated to have taken place at least 20 days ago.

BHAWANIPATNA: The carcass of an adult elephant was found in a partially decomposed state from Ranibahal revenue forest on the outskirts of Karlapat wildlife sanctuary in Kalahandi's Thuamul Rampur block on Saturday. The tushes of the female elephant, aged around 35 years, were missing from the carcass. It is believed that the jumbo got separated from its herd and died around 20 days back. On being informed, forest officials rushed to the spot, which is near Kardapadar beat under Silet panchayat. During investigation, it was ascertained that one Dana Majhi of Surumundi village and his associates had removed the tushes from the carcass. Kalahandi divisional forest officer (DFO), South T Ashok Kumar said the tushes were recovered from Dana's house. Two persons were also arrested for their involvement in removing the tushes. They are Sani Majhi of Surumundi and Prashant Kaushalya of Mutukuni. However, prime accused Dana is on the run. The DFO informed that Dana has reportedly escaped to Rayagada district. The Rayagada forest officials have been informed and efforts are on to nab him, he added. Sources said it is yet to be ascertained if the elephant was killed by poachers or died of any other cause. A veterinary team conducted postmortem of the carcass and samples of its lungs, intestine and bone marrow were sent to Animal Disease Research Institute, Cuttack and Centre for Wildlife Health at OUAT, Bhubaneswar for testing. Kumar said the movement of the remaining elephants of the herd, which is roaming in and around the sanctuary, is being monitored with a joint team of Kalahandi and Rayagada forest personnel. This is the second elephant death reported from Karlapat wildlife sanctuary in the month. In the first week of June, the carcass of a six-month-old calf was found at Katingkuna within the sanctuary. As many as nine elephants have died in and around the sanctuary in the last five months. In February this year, carcasses of five female elephants and two calves were found inside the sanctuary. The deaths were attributed to haemorrhagic septicemia.

They were identified as YP, a 52-years-old teacher from Jambi, YS, a 52-year-old man working for a private company, and WG, a 68-year-old farmer from Riau. ""Each individual has a different role. YP was the seller, YS acted as the middleman, while WG was a potential customer,"" Riau Police special crime department head Sr. Comr. Andri Sudarmadi said on Friday. Local authorities first received a tip about illegal ivory trading several months ago, he said, prompting the Riau Police to form a special investigation team to track down the perpetrators involved. On Wednesday, the team followed the three suspects as they drove from WP's house to a workshop in Jake village, Central Kuantan, a district in Kuantan Senggigi regency. The three were arrested as they were making a transaction inside the workshop at around 11 a.m., Andri said. Police personnel found two 80-centimeter-long elephant tusks wrapped in a burlap sack in the suspects' car. The tusks were carved and filled with cement. ""We suspect that the potential buyer planned to resell the tusks in Pekanbaru,"" he said. ""We're currently investigating the case further to track down and arrest the poachers involved."" The police are coordinating with the Riau Natural Resource Conservation Agency (BBKSDA) to determine where the tusks came from. According to the police, the suspects told them it was their first time attempting to trade elephant tusks. ""They were interested in selling elephant tusks because of their high economic value. A pair of tusks can cost Rp 100 million [US$7,033],"" Andri said. The suspects were charged under Article 21 and Article 40 of Law No.5/1990 on natural resources and ecosystem conservation and Article 55 of the Criminal Code, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of Rp 100 million. Poaching is a major cause of elephant deaths in the country every year. The problem is exacerbated by rampant deforestation, which has reduced the elephantsâ€™ natural habitat and brought them into conflict with humans.

118044,"Two of the Democratic Republic of Congoâ€™s most prolific wildlife traders have been handed jail terms this year, in a rare spell of conservation wins for Congolese law enforcement. Salomon Mpay 51, was arrested at a Kinshasa hotel on Jan. 30, following a two-year joint investigation between the Congolese Institute for the Conservation of Nature (ICCN) and Conserv Congo, a Kinshasa-based not-for-profit. Mpay, who goes by the pseudonym of â€œThe King,â€ was caught with 35 kilograms (77 pounds) of cut-up ivory, which he intended to sell to an undercover agent posing as a client. He was also in possession of almost 2.5 metric tons of pangolin scales. However, delays in issuing a search warrant following his arrest meant accomplices had time to move the contraband before the authorities could return to seize the goods. Photos on his cellphone indicated a further ivory stockpile of 3 metric tons kept at an undisclosed location; investigators are actively looking for the items. Similar quantities of pangolin scales and ivory have sold for as much as $8 million and $6 million, respectively. On April 22 [2021], Gombe Magistrates Court in Kinshasa, the capital, sentenced Mpay to two years in prison. While Mpayâ€™s arrest has been hailed by conservationists as a rare victory in the fight against the illegal wildlife trade in DRC, lawyers acting on behalf of ICCN, the state-run wildlife authority, and Conserv Congo have lodged an appeal, through the public prosecutorâ€™s office, describing the sentence as unduly lenient for a transnational wildlife trafficker whose career spans three decades. â€œHe is one of the few local traders that I know of who has got a passport full of stamps â€” mainly in Africa,â€ Conserv Congo founder Adams Cassinga told Mongabay. Mpay is linked to a number of traffickers across the continent, including in Zambia, Uganda, Burundi, South Sudan, Central African Republic, Angola, Republic of Congo, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. Documents in his possession at the time of his arrest attested to his dealings with people in Southeast Asia, where he is known to have sent multiple consignments of wildlife contraband. â€œHe is a major link. A network is a chain of people, you can cut the link â€” his conviction wonâ€™t affect the trade, per se, but it will affect the organization,â€ Cassinga added. The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) is providing financial and legal assistance to support the appeal.

A team of forest officers raided an apartment in Tripunithura here and arrested five youths while they were trying to sell two elephant tusks on Tuesday. P A Jaleel, Range Forest Officer, flying squad, Perumbavoor, said the elephant tusks, weighing 1.046kg and 1.226kg, were seized from the five youths â€“ Roshan Ramkumar, 29, of Tripunithura; Shebin Sasi, 28, of Eroor; Midhun T M, 26, of Irinjalakuda; Sanoj T A, 30, and Shemeer K R, 36, of Paravoor. The gang had been demanding Rs 1 crore for the tusks, which are said to be worth Rs 40 lakh in the international market. Posing as prospective buyers, a team led by Ernakulam Forest flying squad DFO Raju K Francis contacted the gang, which was staying at Jasmine Apartment on Irumpanam road.  This is the second elephant tusk seizure this month. On January 6, employees of Valara forest station under the Neriyamangalam range had arrested a man and seized two elephant tusks. The arrest came following a search which was launched after an elephant bone was found on the land owned by Abdul Salim of Kullamankuzhi. A male elephant had been electrocuted and Santhosh, 45, a worker, had cut its tusks and kept them in his house. The team led by range officer Arun K Nair and deputy ranger R Ajay had raided his house and recovered the tusks.

118062,"An adjutant of the national gendarmerie and a sergeant of the Congolese armed forces were arrested for ivory trafficking (illegal possession of ivory tusks) during an operation which saw the dismantling of a network of suspected ivory traffickers. Four civilians, members of this network, were also arrested during an operation carried out by elements of the National Gendarmerie. The six alleged traffickers who make up the network were arrested successively on January 27, 28, 31 and February 2, 2021 in Pointe-Noire, the economic capital of the Republic of Congo. This series of arrests was carried out with the support of agents from the Departmental Directorate of Forest Economy of Pointe Noire and PALF (Support Project for the Application of the Law on Wildlife). This punch operation allowed the seizure of four (4) ivory tusks, weighing 101.3 kg, representing approximately four (4) slaughtered elephants, several objects worked in ivory namely 20 sticks, 15 pendants, 04 round bracelets, 02 chopsticks with balls. Initially, four individuals were arrested, including two on 27 January [2021] and the other two on 28 January 2021 with an ivory tusk. The investigations into this case led to the arrest of two other members of this network. The adjutant was arrested on January 31, 2021 with two (2) ivory tusks and the sergeant arrested with an ivory tusk on February 2, 2021. This soldier of the Congolese armed forces confessed to having used his service weapon to shoot down an elephant in the forest of the district of Banda in the Department of Niari. The other five are being prosecuted for the offenses of illegal possession, circulation and marketing of the seized ivory tusks. Note that the arrested gendarme is also a sculptor and sells products worked in ivory. These alleged wildlife offenders, all of Congolese nationality, have all admitted the facts with which they are accused. They are said to be familiar with the illegal trade in wildlife products in the town of Pointe Noire. The ivory seized is believed to come from the villages of Konongo in the Department of Kouilou and Ngokosso in the District of Banda, Department of Niari. The latter will answer for their acts before the Congolese justice and risk sentences of up to five years of imprisonment and 5 million FCFA in fines, each. The illegal trade in wildlife products is leading to the extinction of wildlife species around the world. This illegal trafficking is the third most profitable form of trade after drugs and weapons. Recall that the elephant enjoys absolute protection in the Republic of the Congo following the 1991 decree as well as an act of the Sovereign National Conference. The species is threatened with extinction in many places in Congo due to poaching for its spikes. Article 27 of the Congolese law on the protection of this wildlife species states: ""the importation; export; the detention and transit on national territory of fully protected species; as well as their trophies are strictly prohibited; except special dispensation from the water and forestry administration; for the needs of scientific research â€.

Gabon News; 2019-06-18
The operation begins on Saturday, June 15, 2019 at 12 noon. Samuel Adama, 28, is a Ghanaian national. The team of conservationists, made up of agents of the judicial police (PJ) branch of the province of Nyanga (south-east Gabon) and agents of the provincial directorate of the same service, supported by the NGO Conservation Justice, surprised him in a motel room, a place more used by traffickers. He had in his possession an ivory point of about 22kg, cut into three pieces. At the origin of this important operation, reliable information reached the agents evoking the detention and marketing in progress of an ivory point in a motel in the city of Tchibanga. In Nyanga province, not a month goes by without a case of wildlife trafficking. When questioned, the offender was not asked to denounce one of his accomplices, Yves Kevin Mihindou, a 31-year-old Gabonese. The latter will eventually be apprehended a few hours later, thanks to the tenacity of the police and members of the NGO Conservation Justice. He will admit that his dirty work was organized with two other accomplices. The two other accomplices wanted by the police were finally apprehended in turn on June 17 while they were in the village in the region of Dubinda-forest where the accomplices usually conduct their hunting party. They are CÃ©dric Moundounga and Lewis Mouketou, two Gabonese aged 31 and 25 respectively. The four offenders are currently in police custody at the PJ premises pending further proceedings. Law enforcement officers remain vigilant as their struggle continues.

117989,"A Retired Italian Diplomat, Diego Marino Enrico has been arrested and is presently under detention at the Jinja Road Police Station after his house was searched and over 5 Kilograms of Ivory discovered. Diego, 79, though retired, still carries a Red Passport and a business card indicating him as a Consultant Deputy Consul General, with his address being Consulate General of Italy, 2590 Webster Street, San Francisco CA 94115. Exhibits He was arrested on Tuesday [13/04/2021] by detectives stationed at the Bugolobi Police Station in Kampala, and later transferred to Jinja Road Police Station. This followed the arrest of his Wife the previous Monday [12/04/2021], a Ugandan, who was detained at the Bugolobi Police Station, together with the Local Council leader of Panda â€“ Pier Village, in Nakawa, a Division within Kampala City. â€˜â€™The Local Council Leader, Tomusange Joseph, was nabbed with 2.5Kgs of worked Ivory pieces, following a trap laid by officers from the Natural Resources Conservation Network (NRCN) working closely with some detectives from the Uganda Police Force who presented themselves as buyers of the costly Ivory piecesâ€™â€™, revealed a source. Some of the Exhibits Upon probing, Tomusange led Police detectives and the Conservationists from NRCN to the home of the former Italian Consul, where a further house search was done, leading to the discovery of more 3.75Kgs of worked Ivory pieces. â€˜â€™On Saturday [10/04/2021], an officer of the NCRN had received a call from a whistle blower who tipped him that there was someone in Luzira with some Kilogrammes of Ivory to sell. The Officer immediately informed Police about the developmentâ€™â€™, added a source. The following Sunday [11/04/2021], the officers of the NRCNâ€“ Uganda, with Police, met their informer, who showed them the ivory from a hidden sack. â€˜â€™On confirming that the items in the sack were genuine Ivory pieces, the detectives immediately introduced themselves to Tomusange and arrested him. They then demanded that he takes them to the source of the Ivoryâ€™â€™, revealed an official from NRCN. Tomusange led the detectives to the residence of the diplomat, where a stand-off ensued, between the detectives and the Diplomatâ€™s caretakers, who denied access. In the ensuing struggle for access to carry out a search, the caretakers released a guard dog which bit and injured one of the detectives on the left arm, before it was eventually subdued. In his statement to Police at Bugolobi Police Station, Mr Diego Marino did not deny that he was the owner of the Ivory pieces. Nonetheless, he says he had bought them several years ago from a hawker who he hasnâ€™t identified. â€œI donâ€™t sell Ivory. I have been here for over 10 years. I bought these things from a hawker here in Kampalaâ€, Diego told the detectives from Bugolobi Police station. In Uganda though, offences related to trafficking in Wildlife are Strict Liability offences, meaning that regardless of what the defendantâ€™s intents or mental state was when committing the act, possession of those materials can constitute criminal liability. The Officer in Charge Investigations at the Bugolobi Police station, James Mutaire, says Mr Diego Marino will be charged with 2 counts against wildlife. â€œWe prefer 2 charges against him. One is Unlawful Possession of Specimen of Protected Wildlife contrary to Section 36 (1), and Section 71(1)(B) of the Uganda Wildlife Act, and secondly, Unlawful Transfer of Specimen of Protected Species contrary to Section 36(1) and Section 71 (1)(B) of the Uganda Wildlife Actâ€, said Mutaire. Exhibits On Monday, Experts from the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) joined the team of the Natural Resource Conservation Network (NRCN) to help with identification and prosecution of the suspects. In her 6 â€“ page technical report dated April 13, 2021, an UWA Sergeant Major Twinamatsiko Harriet noted that she had confirmed that the 5.5Kgs of specimens handed to her by the police were actually of protected wildlife. â€œHaving closely examined the features of the specimens as above and relating them with the known features of an Elephant and Hippopotamus, it was 99.9% highly probable that the specimens were 56 cut worked elephant Ivory pieces and one worked hippopotamus incisor tooth.â€ She said that her findings meant that at least 3 endangered animal species could have been killed to extract the pieces she observed. â€œAt least two elephants died to obtain the specimens as described above considering the fact that an elephant has a pair of tusks and there were two complete worked tusks and several chopped ones. At least a hippopotamus died to obtain the one piece of the hippopotamus incisor tooth because the hippopotamus incisor belongs to the hippopotamus.

An ivory trafficker arrested with 13 pieces of elephant ivory in the South of the country. We still don't know why the ivory was covered with the black material. In the past some paint on contraband has been used as a black magic protection for the traffickers - that didn't work so well for them as they were jailed. A shotgun was seized in the traffickerâ€™s house.

The son of a former finance minister has been arrested alongside four others for trafficking in wildlife products. They were about to carry out an illegal transaction involving the sale of two ivory tusks when wildlife officials arrived the scene at the Omnisport neighbourhood in Yaounde. The arrest was done during the crackdown operation led by the Centre Regional Delegation for Forestry and Wildlife in collaboration with the Ngousso Gendarmerie Brigade in Yaounde. A nongovernmental organization called LAGA technically assisted the operation. The former finance ministerâ€™s son aged 44 transported the tusks in his black Toyota Prado car, accompanied by his accomplices to   the Omnisport neighourhood where they were just about to off load the ivory from the trunk of the car when gendarmes and wildlife officials swooped in and arrested all five.  The suspects were found in illegal possession of two big ivory tusks weighing over 50kg. According to eye witness accounts, one of the suspects sensing danger, attempted to pass through the dragnet. He slowly and confidently walked away from the scene but was quickly recognized, stopped and arrested alongside the others. The two ivory tusks were unusually big and weighed over 50kg indicating they were cut from a big elephant, something which is not very common today. Elephant tusks weighing over 20kg are difficult to find nowadays and some experts suggest this could be the result of intense poaching of elephant in the sub region with individuals in the various herds not allowed to grow to big enough sizes or are simply shot dead before they attain their full size. They also say this is also an indication of the fact that the elephant would have been killed in the savanna region because forest elephants have smaller ivory sizes.

A young couple was caught trafficking ivory on August 27, 2019 in Fougamou. The branch of the Judicial Police (PJ) in NgouniÃ© has just made a big catch in Fougamou. A young woman and her husband were caught trafficking ivory spikes on 27 August. Aged 22, Marie-Laure Motambi Ngoubou and her lover Sylla Demba (24), were taken to Mouila and placed in custody at the PJ premises. The alleged traffickers will then be transferred to Libreville to be brought before the special panel of the Libreville Court. They face up to ten years in prison. Accompanied by elements of the Provincial Directorate of Water and Forests and the NGO Conservation Justice, the PJ agents were alerted by an anonymous source. Arriving in Fougamou in the early afternoon of August 27, it was around 3 p.m. that the team managed to arrest Marie-Laure Motambi Ngoubou, in possession of three ivory points that she was about to sell. The girl will try to exonerate herself, claiming not to know the contents of the cardboard in which the tips were hidden. The girl will eventually denounce her accomplice and lover. The latter will be apprehended in turn in the village, in Sindara, while he was waiting for the money from the sale. A new grip that questions the extent of ivory trafficking in the country.

He offered a partial plea when he appeared before Hwange Provincial magistrate, Portia Mhlanga facing five counts of unlawful possession of animal trophies. He argued that he had picked the trophies from the Hwange National Park while herding cattle and intended to use them for medicinal purposes. â€œYour worship, I do admit to the charge that the items were found in my bedroom hut, however, I did not kill those animals to get the trophies. Instead, I picked up all these things in the national park while herding cattle after I learnt that animal remains can be used to cure different ailments,â€ Ndlovu said. On November 9 last year, police officers were making a follow up on a bicycle belonging to Mambanje Primary School which Ndlovu, a former committee member, was refusing to surrender. Upon arrival, Ndlovuâ€™s mother, Georgina, welcomed them into the homestead before informing them that her son was not at home. She led them to Ndlovuâ€™s grass thatched bedroom hut where they recovered the bicycle in question. However, as the police officers were about to leave the room, one of them noticed a wild animal skin protruding from underneath Ndlovuâ€™s bed and decided to investigate, whereupon he uncovered a female lion trophy. Suspecting more surprises, the two officers conducted through searches of the room and homestead, leading to the recovery of 16 pangolin scales valued at $5 000, a 3,5-metre-long python skin valued at $1 500, a female lion skin, three lion paws, lion teeth and baboon skull worth $20 500.

A gang of 17 suspected ivory smugglers have been arrested for possession of 10 elephant tusks, Shenzhen CustomsÂ announcedÂ during a press conference last Thursday. The ivory seized is said to be of African origin and weighs about 323.7 kilograms in total. The suspects were attempting to smuggle the illegal animal parts from Hong Kong into the Chinese mainland. The suspects, which include sixÂ Hong KongÂ residents, have now been detained for further investigation, according toÂ China Daily. Shenzhen Customs described this as a â€˜major ivory-smuggling caseâ€™ and said that they became aware of the groupâ€™s presence in 2017, when a similar case was being investigated in Zhanjiang, another city in Guangdong. The group had been using highly stealthy and sophisticated communication lines during their operation, making the case a hard nut to crack. Although customs agents teamed up with police from multiple cities, including Shenzhen, Maoming,Â Zhuhai, Fuzhou and Hong Kong, it wasnâ€™t until this July, afterÂ two raidsÂ were carried out, that the joint police force managed to seal off this smuggling channel.

Customs officers from Guangdong province and Hong Kong seized 10 pieces of African ivory, weighing 323.7 kilograms, after cracking down on a major smuggling operation. Seventeen suspects, including six Hong Kong residents, were detained for further investigation, according to Ma Dongsheng, a senior customs officer with the anti-smuggling bureau of Shenzhen Customs. ""A major smuggling channel that used to be active in smuggling African ivory to the mainland has been destroyed after a major smuggling gang was busted during the operation,"" Ma told a news conference on Thursday. Led by the General Administration of Customs, a special task force was set up after customs officers in Zhanjiang, Guangdong, seized smuggled ivory late last year. A gang of smugglers, including members from the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong, are suspected of taking African ivory into Guangdong via Hong Kong, Ma said. The task force consisted of customs officers from Shenzhen, Zhanjiang and Fuzhou, Fujian province.

Anamalai Tiger Reserve (ATR) officials, along with Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), seized a pair of elephant tusks on Tuesday. Six persons, including an anti-poaching watcher, were arrested. According to sources, the accused have been identified as P Manikandan (38), owner of a pet shop, K Samiyappan, an anti-poaching watcher at Pollachi forest range in ATR, A Kathavarayan, a sanitary worker, M Sikkanthar Basha, footwear shopkeeper, K Sharathi a grove labourer, and A Nandhakumar, who works as a lab assistant at a private college. Following a tip-off about the tusks being sold through a pet shop near Shanmugapuram, a team of WCCB and forest staff, disguised as buyers, confirmed that the accused were selling the tusks. After grilling the shopkeeper, Manikandan, he confessed that Samiyappan and Kathavarayan had collected the tusks from the forest in Pollachi during their routine patrolling and kept it in a grove with the help of Sharathi and Sikkanthar. Subsequently, Manikandan decided to sell through his friend Nandhakumar to potential buyers, sources said. Sources added that Samiyappan and Kathavarayan had found an elephant carcass inside Pollachi forest range and took its tusks on December 14. ""Age of the animal is suspected to be between 10 to 15 years, and it could have died a few months ago. After noticing the carcass at Vedikaranpallam in Pollachi forest range, the duo must have gone inside the forest without taking GPS on December 14 to collect the tusks,"" said Xavier Deputy Director of ATR S Arokiyaraj. ""The gang was waiting to get Rs 3 lakh by selling the tusks. They were carrying out the negotiation through WhatsApp. However they were caught within ten days. They were produced before the Pollachi Judicial Magistrate II and were remanded in Coimbatore Central Prison,"" he added.

113185,"Federal authorities revealed Wednesday [02/01/2019] that they raided the home of an Oakdale couple in December and confiscated a variety of rhinoceros and elephant parts that the pair claimed they had collected as family heirlooms. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service launched the investigation in 2016, and it led to a search on Dec. 12 [2018] of a home in the 4700 block of Helmo Avenue occupied by Chang Xiong and his wife, Ma Chang. Search warrant documents unsealed Wednesday [02/01/2019] in federal court in St. Paul show that investigators seized seven rhino feet, five rhino toenails, a rhino horn and two wine cups, two walking stick handles, a snuff bottle and a ring, all made from rhino parts. They also seized a carved elephant tusk, an ivory figurine and two bracelets and a ring. Neither Xiong nor Chang has been charged with a crime. Darin Brandenburg, a special agent with the wildlife service based in Madison, Wis., outlined the investigation in a statement to support the warrant. Brandenburg wrote that it began May 11, 2016, when a source who runs a taxidermy business in the United Kingdom sent U.S. authorities an e-mail indicating that Xiong had tried to buy a rhinoceros foot. He said the source explained to Xiong that it would be illegal to ship the foot to the U.S., but he sent him Brandenburgâ€™s covert e-mail address, indicting that he might be able to help. Brandenburg said Xiong sent him an e-mail looking for rhino feet and continued his pursuit of the contraband even after being told that they had to be careful to avoid getting into trouble. Xiong said he had bought a rhino foot in April 2016 from a seller in Florida without any trouble. They eventually agreed to meet at a Home Depot parking lot in Hudson, Wis., to make a deal. Xiong and Chang arrived at the lot in July 2016 in a black Mercedes, Brandenburg said. After Chang inspected a rhino foot that was secretly marked with â€œfluorescent invisible detection paste,â€ Xiong paid Brandenburg $1,100. State and federal investigators followed the couple back to their home in the 1900 block of Montana Avenue E. in St. Paul, where they lived at the time, and watched them unload the foot. In November 2016, Customs and Border Protection agents intercepted a 24-pound shipment of elephant toenails, bone and two small unidentified animal horns. They released the shipment and it was delivered to Xiong at his St. Paul address. He arranged another covert sale to Xiong of a rhinoceros foot for $1,100 in September 2017. â€œXiong inspected the foot and said he was going to display it in his house,â€ Brandenburg wrote. â€œI asked Xiong how many rhinoceros feet he had now. Xiong replied saying he only had the two he had bought from me. â€¦ Chang said she had eight relatives so she wanted me to find a rhinoceros foot for each of them. Chang also said she wanted a rhinoceros foot for each of her four children.â€  Chang, who is from Thailand, explained that rhinoceros parts are good luck. Xiong immigrated to the U.S. more than 20 years ago from Laos. In the Hmong culture, Brandenburg wrote, â€œrhinoceros parts and elephant ivory are symbols of wealth and prosperity.â€  Authorities inspected a package shipped to Xiong from the United Kingdom in January 2018 that contained a rhinoceros foot.  Brandenburg said he arranged another sale of two more rhinoceros feet in December for $1,600.  In addition, he said, Xiong bought an elephant tusk through a Canadian auction firm and it was shipped to him with a customs form declaring it as plastic.

113308,"Tanzania has seized ivory tusks equivalent to killing at least 117 elephants, its tourism minister said, part of its drive to stamp out organized criminal networks involved in years of industrial-scale poaching. The elephant population in Tanzania, famed for its wildlife reserves, shrank from 110,000 in 2009 to barely 43,000 in 2014, according to a 2015 census, with conservation groups blaming rampant poaching. The government says numbers have now started to recover. Demand for ivory from Asian countries such as China and Vietnam, where it is turned into jewels and ornaments, has driven the surge in poaching across Africa. Hamisi Kigwangalla, minister for Natural Resources and Tourism, said on his Twitter account late on Wednesday the ivory was recovered after authorities arrested suspected â€œhardcoreâ€ poacher Hassan Shaban Likwema, also known by the alias Hassan Nyoni. â€œThe arrest of Nyoni has brought us to a stage where we can say we have taken into custody all the hardcore poachers on our wanted list, except for a few who have left the country,â€ Kigwangalla said. â€œNyoni and his accomplicesâ€™ consignment is worth 4 billion shillings ($1.74 million) and involved the killing of 117 elephants going back to 2015 and earlier,â€ he said. Neither Likwema nor his accomplices were immediately reachable for comment.

An international poaching syndicate, whose member was arrested during Ops Khazanah recently, is believed to have used AK47 rifles and wire snares to hunt endangered species. Sources said the syndicate, with members comprising locals and those from neighbouring countries, has been active in hunting wildlife and collecting their parts in Kelantan jungles for more than three years. The source said the poachers have targeted endangered species such as tigers, elephants and sun bears. ""The Kelantan international poaching syndicate has at least 10 members and the rich profits from the business prompted them to sell different parts of the animals on the black market,"" the source told the New Straits Times. The source said the finding was made following the seizure of a tiger, panther carcasses and 10 pieces of ivory worth more than RM500,000 during the operation in Tanah Merah. ""With the arrest of the suspect and the seizure of the carcasses and the ivory, police believe organised criminals are behind these cruel acts. ""The hunters set up the wire snares in the jungles and later kill the animals, mostly for their parts. ""The authorities involved in the operation are now tracking down the rest of the syndicate members who they believe are still in the state,"" said the source. The source said it is believed that a tiger is sold for its skin, bones, teeth, claws, tail and even whiskers which can find a place on the black market as decorative items or ingredients in traditional medicines. A 25-year-old man, believed to be a member of the syndicate, was arrested in the 3am operation and was remanded for four days beginning yesterday. Investigations showed that the carcasses and ivory had been kept at a premises since April and were to be sent to their intended destinations soon.

Almost 10kg of ivory products have been recovered in Vinh Phuc after police acted on a dossier of evidence compiled by ENV. Our profile of the illegal wildlife trader enabled police officers to catch him red-handed while he was on the way to sell a number of ivory items. A subsequent search of the suspectâ€™s house uncovered a number of other ivory products including combs, bracelets, statues and incense burners. The products seized were confirmed as ivory by the Institute of Ecology and Biological Resources (IEBR) in Hanoi.

The Education for Nature-Vietnam (ENV) said on February 21 that 19 wild animals of rare and threatened species were rescued from illegal traders and trappers, and subsequently released back into nature in January. Eight animals were handed over voluntarily by local people â€“ consisting of two pangolins, one red-shanked douc langur, one python, and four monkeys â€“ and taken to either nature reserves or released back into nature. The ENV said that competent authorities also seized many wild animal products, including 9.94kg of elephant tusks in Vinh Phuc province. It also detected and worked to remove 54 online pages that contained illegal wildlife trading information. According to ENV Vice Director Bui Thi Ha, the result is a vivid illustration of the radical change in public awareness of wildlife protection. Strict punishment must be meted out to any violations in order to prevent such crimes, she suggested. As advertisements for and the illegal trading of wildlife animals on the Internet are common violations, competent authorities should enhance control to ban wrongdoers from using social networking platforms to sell wild animals, Ha said. Some 521 endangered wildlife animals were saved in Vietnam in 2018 thanks to the engagement of people and law enforcement agencies. Up to 1,666 wildlife-related violations were also detected, of which 64 percent were involved in illegally advertising and trading endangered animals and related products.

The arrested was Purushothaman of Kurathikudy tribal settlement at Adimaly. According to Forest department officials, a pair of ivory tusks weighing 9 kg was seized from the possession of the accused. The ivory tusks were seized by the Forest intelligence wing. Adimaly range officer Joji James and Devikulam range officer P.V. Vegi, led the team. The Forest department officials approached the accused as ivory tusk buyers. The accused had hidden the ivory tusks inside a sack behind his house. According to officials, in his statement to the forest, the accused said that two people, Balan and Unni from the Elamblassery settlement, had handed over the ivory tusks to him around six months before. The accused was produced before the Adimaly Judicial First Class Magistrate Court on Saturday and has been remanded to judicial custody. â€œThe probe is going on, and more accused will be arrested soon,â€ said a Forest department official.

In a joint operation with their Kerala counterparts, the Karnataka Forest Department recently busted what it said was a gang of poachers operating from Elachivali in Attappadi in the Palakkad district of Kerala. Following the covert operation, the Kerala Forest Department arrested five men and seized wildlife trophies â€” including leopard, sloth bear, and wild boar teeth, two elephant tusks, a bottle of animal fat, and a piece of sandalwood â€” from them. Three of the arrested four have been identified as Sibi Kaidukuli (57), a resident of Elachivali and a farmer with a banana plantation on eight acres; Asghar Pasha (37), a painter from Melathur in Malappuram, and Yousthas Khan (40), a furniture businessman from Pandikadu in Malappuram. The other two are Anil and Sibiâ€™s aide Rajesh. The search party also seized four locally-made muzzleloaders, 10 machetes, three bags of gunpower weighing 5 kg, and other combustible substances from them. The local police invoked the Arms Act and the Explosive Substances Act while booking them. Thunderbolts, the Kerala policeâ€™s elite commando unit, were also alerted since Maoists have often surfaced in Attappadi. A Karnataka Forest CID probe led to the arrest of the four men. The CID was in pursuit of ivory artefacts being smuggled from Mysuru. Forest Department officials said on Saturday, 16 December, that the ivory carvers â€” migrants from south and central Kerala â€”  were under surveillance. Several such carvers had migrated to Karnataka between 2015 and 2017, they added. â€œIt is their traditional occupation. They came on our radar and we started arresting those involved in the illegal ivory carving business,â€ a senior forest official told South First. â€œMigrants from Kerala in and around Mysuru were initially into wood-carving. Since huge money is involved in ivory carving, they established a network of agents in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, who supplied them with ivory,â€ said the officer. â€œThey mostly carved idols of gods, which were in high demand in North India. Families in North India offer ivory idols of Hindu gods as dowry so that they are passed on to the next generations,â€ he explained. Pasha, who supplied ivory to artisans, had been under the Karnataka Forest CIDâ€™s surveillance. The officials had information that he was dealing with ivory artefacts worth lakhs of rupees. They also learnt that Asghar was in touch with Sibi in Kerala. In the first week of December, Karnataka and Kerala forest departments conducted a joint sting operation and sent a decoy as a customer to Sibiâ€™s house to buy an ivory artefact. Subsequently, four men were arrested, while Anil escaped. However, a special investigation team of the Kerala Forest Department arrested him from his house and seized two country-made muzzleloaders from him. Officials in the search party said Sibiâ€™s house looked like a blacksmith or a gunsmithâ€™s workshop. The trophies seized from Sibiâ€™s house were sent for forensic examination. Meanwhile, an NIA team might visit Attappadi following the seizure of firearms and ammunition.

According to the charge sheet, Thusego Masisi, 34, Onneetse Molefhe, 34, and Maxwell Fanikiso, 37, were allegedly found in possession of a 12.6 kg elephant tusk near Nzano Mall in Francistown on March 27, 2020. The charge specifies that they had no permit or licence for the possession of the tusk, which was being transported in a BWM car with registration B 239 BEM and valued at P24,000. During the court proceedings, Masisi's attorney, Mongiwethu Nehwati, conveyed that her client, upon arrest, had the chance to inspect the tusk at the police station. At that time, it was broken but not cut at its tip, as it is currently presented in court. In response, Molefhe stated he had nothing to add, while Fanikiso echoed Masisi's sentiments. Meanwhile, when the court went to Kutlwano Police Station for an inspection in loco (to enable the cort to observe real evidence in addition to oral evidence), Nehwati reminded the court that a previous order granted the car owner teh right to possess but not sell the vehicle until the conclusion of the case. As per the law, if it's proven beyond reasonable doubt that the BMW was unlawfully transporting the tusk, it will be forfeited to the state. The trio is scheduled to appear in court on February 1, 2024, for the continuation of the trial before Principal Magistrate Tshepo Magetse.

He demanded before the court that the suspect committed the offence contrary to Section 86 (i)(ii) of the Wildlife Conservation Act Cap 5 of 2009 and Article 14 (d) table 57 (1) of economic sabotage as revised in 2002. Mr Mwita prayed the court to issue stern punishment in order to server as a lesson to servants of God and general public that engage in such illegal dealings. However, defence lawyer Sostenes Mseligwa asked the court to reduce the punishment to his client because it was the first time he committed the offence. Also, he said his client had a wife and children who depended on him and that he constituted the countryâ€™s human resource because he was still young.

3 traffickers arrested with 5 ivory tusks and an elephant tail. They had shot and killed baby elephants in the Dja reserve, using the gun of a retired policeman. They travelled to Sangmelima with the ivory and tail, looking forward to selling the illegal products. All 5 tusks weighed less than 1kg and measured about 14cm each indicating they were removed from the heads of baby elephants that were freshly killed as the tusks stunk when officials removed them from the knacksacks that was used by the traffickers to conceal and carry the products. The traffickers seem to master the Dja reserve very well as they used difficult entry and exit points of the reserve that is protected by natural borders such as rivers.

ZAMBEZI regional police arrested two Zambian nationals for possession of 15 elephant tusks in the Kapani area of the Linyanti constituency on Sunday. The two Zambian nationals, aged 29 and 32, were part of a group of seven, however, five escaped with hunting rifles. Regional police spokesperson inspector Kisco Sitali confirmed the arrest to The Namibian on Monday. He said the suspected transnational armed poachers were intercepted while on their way back from Botswana with the elephant tusks. â€œAfter our successful bust of 24 elephant tusks on Friday, we have intensified our joint security cluster operation in the area. It is now evident with these arrests that our suspicion was right that the poachers will continue to use the routes to smuggle the elephant tusks from Botswana to Zambia,â€ he said. The police are hard at work to find and arrest the suspects who fled the scene, Sitali said. Sundayâ€™s arrests follow the bust of 24 elephant tusks on Friday, when a Namibian driver was arrested in the Batubaja area and seven Zambian nationals fled the scene. The driver claims that he was only called to transport passengers but did not know that they were in possession of elephant tusks. He is expected to appear in the Katima Mulilo Magistrates Court on Monday, while the suspects arrested on Sunday will appear in court this week.

The Lampung Police have arrested three individuals who were allegedly engaged in illegal elephant ivory trade in the region. Lampung Police spokesperson Comr. Zahwani Pandra Arsyad said the suspects â€“ identified as BT, TW and AS â€“ had been apprehended in a hotel in Pringsewu regency on Wednesday. â€œOur officers received information that an illegal transaction involving elephant ivory was about to take place. Following an investigation, the three perpetrators were indeed planning to sell tusks,â€ Pandra said on Thursday as quoted by kompas.com. After confirming the trade, a joint team consisting of the Lampung Policeâ€™s general crimes unit and personnel from the South Bukit Barisan National Park (TNBBS) was deployed to foil the illicit activity. Police seized two tusks as evidence, each measuring about 50 centimeters, and said all three suspects were being questioned about the origin of the tusks. In addition, police confiscated nine ivory smoking pipes and three unprocessed elephant teeth. The suspects were charged under Articles 21 and 40 of Law. 5/1900 on the conservation of natural resources and ecosystems. â€œThey face up to five years in prison and a fine of Rp 100 million (US$6,721),â€ Pandra said. The government has stepped up its measures to crack down on illegal ivory trade in recent years. In April, investigators from the Environment and Forestry Ministry arrested three individuals on suspicion of illegal online trade in ivory and other products from elephants and other endangered animals. The trio allegedly sold jewelry and other accessories like cigarette holders through three separate Facebook accounts.

The allegation by animal lovers that Odisha is a happy hunting ground for elephant poachers has once again received credence as the state forest department officials on Monday night seized around 19 kg of elephant tusks from a car near Bayapita village under Harichandanpur police limits in Keonjhar district. Three persons, all ivory traders, were arrested in this connection. According to reports, the officials, acting on a tip-off about the smuggling of the tusks in the car, chased the vehicle and intercepted it near Bayapita village. On searching the car, the tusks were recovered from the vehicle. The accused were being questioned to ascertain the possible involvement of others in the offence. According to Dr Biswajit Mohanty, an eminent wildlife activist, poachers are indulging in mindless killing of tuskers in the state to extract their teeth. The state government, on the other hand, has not been able to contain such ghastly act because of inadequate focus on the grave issue. â€œDespite Odisha being criticised outside for the rising number of elephant deaths, mostly tuskers, the state forest department has not been able to crack down the poachers and traders. Unless the state government wakes up to nail the poachers, the elephant population here will cease to exist,â€ said Dr Mohanty. Although the state government is arresting poachers from time to time, the killers are being acquitted due to the weak investigation process by the forest officials. Dr Mohanty, who is secretary of Wildlife Society of Odisha, urged the state government to hand over the arrested poachers to the Special Task Force for an effective probe. Of the 784 elephant deaths in Odisha in the last 10 years and four months, 114 were killed by poachers, primarily for Ivory.

119348,"The dead body of a sub adult tusker with both its tusks missing was found in Balumath jungles of Latehar district resulting in widespread anger. Kumar Ashish, conservator of Palamu forest has confirmed the death of the tusker and claimed that both its tusks were missing. Ashish said the tusker was found dead last night itself and the officials were combing the area. The site of the death is in Renchi, the protected forest of Balumath in Latehar district which also falls close to the district of Chatra. Notably, it was the same tusker that was earlier found limping and had undergone a long treatment on its left hind leg. Touring veterinary officer Dr Ajay Kumar was specially brought down to the jungles of Renchi from Bokaro for his treatment under orders of the state government. Sources said Dr Ajay Kumar did his best and the tusker began to recover fast but now it is dead and both its tusks missing. This point showcases that the tusker was killed by poachers for its tusks. However, officials have claimed that they are not sure whether the tusker was killed for its tusks or was it after its death that the tusks were removed. A lagatar24.com correspondent spoke to one of the doctors, Dr V S Dubey, also a 2012 batch IFS officer, who performed the post-mortem on Sunday. Dr Dubey said the tusker had no external injury or wound. There were no scars or holes in its body. Explaining the reason for its demise, Dr Dubey said, â€œThere was definitely internal injury. It was severe. There was a pool of blood inside the body.â€ The internal injury was near the mammary glands of the tusker. The bleeding was very profuse, Dr Dubey added. He said the tusker had a deformity of the leg. Its left hind leg was shorter than its right hind leg. Dr Dubey further added that the left hind leg was shorter by 3 inches. Dr Dubey feared that the serious internal bleeding might have led the tusker to go into shock that led to its death. Conservator Ashish said, â€œThe poachers removed the tusks after the elephantâ€™s death. The location where this elephant was found dead is beyond the territory of the PTR. Sources said Dr Ajay Kumar and Dr R Jojo had taken utmost care of its treatment. Apart from Dr V S Dubey who performed the post mortem there were others namely Dr R Jojo, Dr Om Prakash Sahu, Dr S Kullu and Dr S Kasi who were in the team of Dr Dubey while the post mortem was performed.

118052,"On May 3 [2021], the Federal Police of SÃ£o Paulo took to the streets to carry out search and seizure warrants. The targets of Operation AirÃ¢vata (named after an elephant god in Hindu mythology) were investigated for international trafficking in elephant ivory. Police found more than 200 ivory objects and about 35 fossils in an antique store. The PF action took place in partnership with the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama) and the Environmental Police of the State of SÃ£o Paulo. This operation was an offshoot of Operation Thunder last year. IBAMA identified among the pieces found those that are the teeth of wild animals, such as elephant ivory. No crude parts were found, but objects such as necklaces, bracelets, pendants and statues. The authorities estimate that the added value of the pieces found exceeds R$ 500 thousand. Brazil is a signatory to an international treaty that prohibits the sale of endangered animals. In this case, Asian and African elephants. Due to trafficking, pieces that use ivory need to be accompanied by specific documentation proving that the material used has a regular origin. None of the parts found by the PF had the required paperwork. Combating ivory trafficking is an extremely important environmental action. According to the head of the Federal Police's Crimes Against the Environment Precinct, SebastiÃ£o Pujol, the illegal trade in parts that use elephant teeth leads to the extermination of hundreds of animals a day for profit from the sale of parts. Ibama fined the violators at R$5,000 per item found. The operation targeted a commercial establishment and a residence of the same person, a merchant who has a shop selling semi precious stones and antiques in general. In addition, the investigated man has an activity in the educational area. There was no arrest in the act. During the press conference, when asked if the products were being marketed as if it were something â€œnormalâ€, the delegate implied that they were. â€œIt would be good for people to be aware that the end consumer is collaborating directly with a chain of commerce that results from the slaughter of animals that are endangered, which are elephants,â€ he says. The delegate recalled that, in the first phase of the investigation, materials were found that used ivory in their manufacture in a craft fair in the open space of the Museum of Modern Art of SÃ£o Paulo (MASP). The people found there were directly linked to the merchant, something of the AirÃ¢vata action.

Kanchanaburi forensic police have found five shotgun pellets embedded in the remains of an elephant in Salak Phra wildlife sanctuary in the province, but they do not believe that they were the cause of the animalâ€™s demise. Police used a metal detector to scan the remains of the elephant, which is thought to have died weeks ago, and detected the presence of metal pieces lodged 1-2cm under its skin. The five metal pieces were identified as lead shot from a 12-gauge shotgun cartridge, but police do not believe that they killed the elephant because the wounds had already healed. Police said, however, that poachers had cut into the skull of the elephant to remove its tusks. Meanwhile, veterinarians from the sanctuary in Muang district collected bone and tissue samples for lab tests to determine the cause of death. Officials from the sanctuary have been collecting evidence to enable them to file a complaint with the police.

According to the customs, a Xuzhou-based import and export corporation made a declaration on January 7 about 26 second-hand pianos imported from America. Customs guidelines require importers or exporters to declare the materials such products are made of, including ivory. However, when the company made the declaration, it said the pianos were made of wood and didnâ€™t mention ivory. Officers knew there was a high possibility that some older makes of piano had ivory keys so they opened the container to check. They found eight pianos had ivory on their keys. The importer said it owned a piano teaching center and wanted to import some old pianos for display and performances.

 February 2nd, 2024 (Judgement): The accused, Hoang  Thi Diu, was today found not guilty of dealing in wildlife trophies by Principal Magistrate Gideon Kiage Oenga.  The verdict was not unexpected.
 
The judgement was read by Hon. Oenga. In summary, the he stated that:
â€¢ The prosecution evidence did not clarify if accused was either a tenant or landlord for her to have known contents in the house.
â€¢ There was no additional evidence to show knowledge of her being more than a short stay guest.
â€¢ That the accused had stayed for a very short period therefore could not qualify as a tenant or landlord.
â€¢ By the fact that the prosecution could not show the above, the accused could not be found dealing in wildlife trophies.
 
Court held that the accused was found not guilty and thereby acquitted under section 215 of the CPC.

International Policy Digest; 2024-02-2024
It could have been the proverbial pot of gold. Instead, it became at best, an opportunity lost in the fight against transnational organized wildlife crime. On February 2, a Nairobi area court acquitted Hoang Thi Diu, a female of apparent Vietnamese/Chinese dual citizenship, of charges relating to the dealing and possession of 145 kilograms of ivory, rhino horn, lionâ€™s teeth, and claws.

Objectively, and considering the evidence before the court, the verdict was not incorrect. Evidence not presented, evidence that was contradictory, evidence not challenged, and evidence that was tainted, led the court to the only conclusion to be made.

It began with the sudden and unexpected death of 58-year-old Chinese national, Yang Chang Gui, in the early morning of November 16, 2022. Hoang Thi Diu, who had been given a spare bedroom for a temporary stay, became concerned when, in the early morning, Yang Chang Gui was not answering his continually ringing mobile phones. When she went to investigate, and with the assistance of the building caretaker, they discovered that Yang Chang Gui had seemingly passed away in his sleep.
The police were called to the spacious 3-bedroom apartment on the periphery of Nairobiâ€™s Chinatown and in the process of what was surely expected to be a routine investigation, discovered under the bed of the deceased, three suitcases filled with cut-to-size elephant tusks.

Subsequently, the rest of the apartment was searched and more wildlife trophies and cutting tools were discovered. In the master bedroom was one suitcase with ten pieces of ivory, one piece of carry-on luggage with two rhino horns and two small ivory statues, six walkie-talkie-type devices, binoculars, and a large jar with a whitish liquid that was never identified. In the third bedroom, the bedroom of Hoang Thi Diu, a wrapped bag of lionâ€™s teeth and claws was found. In other areas of the apartment, four hack saws and an electric saw.

On the face of it, the police had inadvertently come across a wildlife trophy consolidation point, a location where wildlife trophies were prepared for their export from Kenya and almost certainly through Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. Investigators had been presented with a serendipitous opportunity to crack an organized crime groupâ€™s wildlife trafficking pipeline in and out of Kenya.

By the time the investigation was complete, however, only Hoang Thi Diu, the short-term roommate who came across the deceased, had been charged. The subsequent trial testimony painted a picture that left more questions than answers, a common characteristic where transnational organized crime and the criminal justice systems go head-to-head. Invariably, in this part of the world, the criminal justice system is the also-ran.
The court was told that Yang Chang Gui had been living in Apartment C13, Sunshine Court, Lavington, for some years, but the number was never quantified. He died from causes never revealed to the court, and the presiding magistrate, Principal Magistrate Gideon Kiage of Kahawa Law Court, left to presume that his passing was not an obvious homicide.

The court was also informed that approximately 28 units of the 50-unit structure were owned by the South Sudanese government and not surprisingly, most of the residents of those apartments were from South Sudan. The deceased reportedly came into his particular apartment when the previous tenants had defaulted on their rent.
Courtroom testimony indicated that it was Yang Chang Guiâ€™s older brother, now living in China, who had initially signed for the apartment and was presently paying the monthly rent; the deceased only paying for the electricity and water. There was never an indication as to whether Yang Chang Gui was gainfully employed and his immigration status in Kenya was never specified.

From an evidentiary perspective, the deceasedâ€™s bedroom was referred to as â€˜Room 1,â€™ the room where 3 suitcases containing 70 pieces of ivory (or 68 pieces) were found. â€˜Room 1,â€™ however, was not the master bedroom. The occupant of â€˜Room 2,â€™ the master bedroom, was Ali Hussein, identified by the Investigating Officer, Chief Inspector Charles Inoti, as an Egyptian national. Chief Inspector Inoti was also, at the time, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations â€˜Liaison Officerâ€™ to the Kenya Wildlife Service and had been for at least 11 years. Inotiâ€™s KWS team had at this point taken over the investigation from the police who were first on the scene.
Courtroom chitchat labelled Ali Hussein as a medical doctor but that was never confirmed. Testimony from the witnesses differed slightly, but it appeared that his room contained the rhino horn, two small ivory statues, six communication devices, binoculars, a large jar with a whitish liquid that was never identified, two safes, 2 to 3 passports, and possibly an air boarding pass.

Whether Ali Hussein lived in the apartment on a full-time or part-time basis was a question never definitively answered. Two of the prosecution witnesses, who were employees of the apartment complex, and the accused, testified that he was a close associate of the accused and lived there essentially on a full-time basis since at least 2021.

Inoti informed the court that after the initial seizure, an immigration alert had been put out for Ali Hussein and he was subsequently arrested at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport coming off an inbound flight. Hussein was arraigned at Kahawa court and in custody for a short period while an investigation was conducted. This included taking him back to the crime scene. Inoti told the court that the investigation cleared Hussein of any involvement in the criminal activity under investigation. He also said that the decision not to charge was made by prosecutors based on the fact that Ali Hussein was not at the scene at the time of the discovery.
The enigma surrounding the deceased and Ali Hussein was matched by that of Hoang Thi Diu. On her initial arrest, police announced that she was a Chinese national with a Chinese passport. Her charge sheet before the court indicated she is a Vietnamese national with a corresponding passport. She told the court in her defense that she had arrived in Kenya from Angola on August 29, 2022, looking for a sister who had run away with a boyfriend who had not been approved by the family. Inoti stated that her entry date was September 3.

She stayed initially at a 4-star hotel with a casino for about 10 days but found it too expensive ($100 per night). While searching for cheaper accommodation, she was introduced to the deceased at the hotel-casino, a casino she had also been led to believe was frequented by her runaway sister. The accused continued by telling the court that the deceased agreed for her to stay in his third bedroom until the permanent room occupant returned. She never touched any of the occupantâ€™s possessions and never saw the ivory or rhino horn in the apartment while she was there. The court was not advised as to whether her sister had ever been located.
While Hoang Thi Duiâ€™s version may have been saleable to someone who knew nothing of the case, it had been already muddied by the testimony of a previous witness. A Chinese national, living just outside Nairobi, testified that he had been contacted by the deceasedâ€™s brother to make the appropriate funeral arrangements and alluded to the court that the accused may have been working as an escort.

In addition, Hoang Thi Diu was seemingly provided a deference by the court during the entire court process. It began with her bail. Hoang Thi Diu, in Kenya from Angola, would surely have been a significant flight risk but was released on a cash bail of $1,300 with one passport being held by the court.
After her first lawyer withdrew from her case (Edwin Motari reportedly came by way of the Chinese community and had been previously arrested by masquerading as a lawyer), the court itself found a second lawyer to act on the accusedâ€™s behalf on a pro-bono basis. That arrangement fell through, and another pro-bono advocate was found.
Her trial was completed in 14 months, taking half the time typically seen for a similar matter. The court sat on 37 occasions to hear eight witnesses during that time. This trial also featured an atypical change in magistrates when Senior Resident Magistrate Boaz Ombewa went on leave and was replaced by Principal Magistrate Gideon Kiage. Far from being a humble single woman looking for a runaway sister, one could not be faulted for believing she was in Nairobi at the bidding of someone else, perhaps as an â€˜escortâ€™ and/or a wildlife trophy â€˜mule.â€™

And what of the mobile phones of the deceased, the ones who according to the accused were ringing in the sitting room, alerting her to the fact that something was not right with the deceased? They were seized by police but did not make it to the inventory list submitted to the court. It only came out in cross-examination that a second inventory had been prepared for court purposes that omitted the seizure of three mobile phones and a printer. Chief Inspector Inoti later testified that the phones had been left off the â€˜amendedâ€™ inventory as they were deemed not relevant to the matter before the court.

Could this not be a case where their irrelevance made them relevant, perhaps even exonerating the accused? And because the phones and printer were left off the inventory, the court was given no indication as to whom they were registered.

In September, in another Nairobi courtroom in another ivory trial, Senior Principle Magistrate S.O. Temu asked rhetorically to the same Chief Inspector Inoti, â€œYou people go for small operators covering the people involved in these wildlife crimes. How do you want the courts to help in ending the trade, while the KWS donâ€™t give us the big guys?â€
Is this not a similar circumstance to the acquittal of Hoang Thu Diu and the exoneration of Ali Hussein? Stakeholders and the public are left to believe that Yang Chang Gui was solely responsible for the wildlife trophy collection point in Apartment C-13; that he kept wildlife trophies, communication devices, and cutting tools essentially all over an apartment shared with two other people, one who had been living there for some time.

Is it possible? Yes, it is possible. We have no idea as to the outcome of investigations completed; whether the working CCTV system of Sunshine Court was examined, whether the cleaner of Yang Chang Guiâ€™s apartment C13 was interviewed, or whether the security agency responsible for the compound were consulted or their vehicle registry checked.

But is it likely? No. Is it believable? No, certainly not when all the facts are examined in concert.
We have a Nairobi apartment located on the periphery of Chinatown, being occupied by a Chinese male for several years with no visible financial means, living in an apartment owned by the South Sudanese government, with rent being paid by someone in China, found with 80 pieces of ivory in his apartment (or 78 pieces, police testimony differs), cut to size in suitcases, two rhino horn, 225 teeth and claws of leopard, lion, baboon and one piece of rhino skin, 6 walkie talkies, saws, a printer, checkbooks, two safes, company seals and stamps.

In addition, the original responding officer omitted to include in his written statement that he found, what were believed to be lion teeth and claws, in the bedroom of the accused, and that both Ali Hussein and Hoang Thi Diu had at least two passports each, that three mobile phones found in the apartment of the deceased were deemed irrelevant before the court, and that a second inventory provided to the court did not include these three phones or a printer also found in the apartment, and that the trial time was at least half of what is typical.

118202,"Officers of Mozambique's National Criminal Investigation Service (Sernic) have seized eleven elephant tusks in a house in the western city of Tete, according to a report in Sunday's on-line issue of the independent daily ""O Pais"". The police struck as the traffickers were about to sell the tusks. The two men found in possession of the tusks have been arrested. The traffickers denied involvement in poaching, and said they were only middlemen hired to sell the ivory. The Tete Sernic provincial spokesperson, Celina Roque, said that, in order to arrest the traffickers, police officers had pretended to be interested in buying the ivory. This is the second ivory seizure reported within a week. The first was a police raid on a house in Boane municipality, about 30 kilometres west of Maputo, in which 50 tusks were seized. It is not yet known whether these elephants were killed in Mozambique on in a neighbouring country. Poachers now face lengthy prison sentences. The killing of any protected species carries a jail sentence of between 12 and 16 years.

ALEXANDRIA, Va. (FOX 5 DC) - A Fredericksburg man pleaded guilty to the sale of elephant and whale ivory. According to court documents, Gary L. Cooper, 60, was using online storefronts from June 2015 to early 2020 to sell elephant and whale ivory, which was in violation of the Endangered Species Act. Officials say Cooper used Craigslist and eBay to sell individual carvings made from ivory. The items ranged in size, including two raw elephant tusks that measured at least 28 inches long. In addition to several raw and carved tusks, the advertisements offered numerous elephant ivory carvings and both raw and scrimshawed sperm whale teeth. Cooper told purchasers, including an undercover agent, that he was selling off an estate belonging to an elderly couple in poor health, when he was really buying ivory online and flipping the pieces. Officials say for about 16 months, beginning in September 2018, Cooper did business with United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) undercover agents by selling or offering about 50 pieces of elephant ivory, valued between $40,000 and $95,000. On November 17, 2018, Cooper offered to sell to an undercover USFWS Special Agent multiple ivory pieces for a total cost of $8,125. On November 26, 2018, he also sold two pieces of carved elephant ivory to the undercover agent and mailed the items from Virginia to New York. Forensics confirmed that it is genuine elephant ivory. Cooper is scheduled to be sentenced on August 31 and has turned over about 136 pieces of raw and carved ivory. He faces a maximum of one year in prison.

A Fredericksburg man pleaded guilty today to the unlawful sale of endangered species, including elephant and whale ivory. According to court documents, Gary L. Cooper, 60, operated online storefronts to sell elephant and whale ivory, all in violation of the Endangered Species Act. From at least June 2015 through early 2020, Cooper used online platforms, such as Craigslist and eBay, to list for sale individual carvings made in whole, or in part, from ivory. These items ranged in size, including two raw elephant tusks that measured at least 28 inches long. In addition to several raw and carved tusks, the advertisements offered numerous elephant ivory carvings and both raw and scrimshawed sperm whale teeth. Cooper told his clients, including an undercover agent, that he was selling off an estate belonging to an elderly couple in poor health, when in reality he was regularly buying ivory online and flipping the pieces for profit. Over about a sixteen-month period beginning in September 2018, Cooper did business with United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) undercover agents by selling or offering for sale no less than 50 pieces of elephant ivory, with a total market value between $40,000 and $95,000. During their correspondence, Cooper and the undercover agents discussed the illegality of buying and selling ivory across state lines. On November 17, 2018, Cooper offered to sell to an undercover USFWS Special Agent multiple ivory pieces for a total cost of $8,125. On November 26, 2018, Cooper sold two pieces of carved elephant ivory to the undercover agent and mailed the items from Virginia to New York. Upon forensic investigation, the items were confirmed to be genuine elephant ivory. Cooper is scheduled to be sentenced on August 31. As part of the plea, Cooper will forfeit approximately 136 pieces of raw and carved ivory. He faces a maximum penalty of 1 year in prison. Actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. Raj Parekh, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, and Ryan Noel, Special Agent-in-Charge, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Office of Law Enforcement, made the announcement after U.S. Magistrate Judge John F. Anderson accepted the plea. This investigation was conducted by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Office of Law Enforcement, with assistance from the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources. Assistant U.S. Attorney Gordon Kromberg and Special Assistant U.S. Attorneys Alejandra Arias and Sara Hallmark are prosecuting the case.

Ivory, in addition to being a constituent element of works of art that can cost tens of thousands of euros, is subject to the protection of CITES, the Washington Convention which regulates international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora. of extinction whose sale without the prescribed CITES documentation constitutes a hypothesis of crime. The European Union already has strict regulations on the ivory trade and is committed to taking further action against elephant poaching and ivory trafficking worldwide. To ensure that the ivory trade in the EU does not contribute to these threats, the EU further tightened its ivory trade rules in December 2021, including a CITES certificate requirement for trade in all ivory items. also for objects prior to 1947 that could be marketed with a simple appraisal or documentation that certifies their qualification as an ancient pre-47 object. The illegal trafficking of the so-called ""white gold"" is currently an important ""business"" linked to the phenomenon of poachers who, without scruples, kill a considerable number of elephants every year, dangerously bringing the species to the threshold of extinction risk. Despite the international ban on the ivory trade, elephant poaching and ivory trafficking are still a relevant phenomenon. CITES entered into force in Italy in 1980 and is currently applied by 183 states. The Washington Convention represents today one of the most important international regulatory instruments to guarantee the conservation of our planet's biodiversity, making the trade of over 35,000 protected species sustainable. A priority task for each State is in fact to monitor and regulate the national and international trade of specimens and products derived from animal and plant species in order to prevent their extinction, in a situation that is already seriously unfavorable due to the negative effects caused by multiple human activities. and climate change that is destroying the natural habitats of numerous species.

Sixty-eight-year-old Italian national, Paolo Brondi, was subsequently arrested.  He initially appeared in a Mombasa court on June 20th before Principle Magistrate Martin Rabera and pled guilty to all charges relating to the .6 kg ivory statue that was found in his luggage.  As there was no Italian interpreter in court, Magistrate Rabera adjourned the case to June 22nd and so ordering an interpreter to attend. He was not comfortable that Brondi had a full appreciation to the seriousness of the charges he was facing. On June 22nd, with an interpreter in court, Paulo Brondi pled not guilty to four charges; possession of wildlife trophy, manufacturing an item from a specified endangered trophy, importing a wildlife trophy into the country and bringing into a customs area prohibited goods, the last charge under the East Africa Community Customs Act. Magistrate Rabera has remanded Brondi until July 1st pending a probation report for the purposes of bond decision. It is reported that he is a regular but part time resident of Watamu.

He is certainly not a poacher, nor an international smuggler of valuables, and even less of a thug. But Paolo Brondi, a Piedmontese who travels back and forth from Italy to Watamu, where he would plan to settle a few months a year, now faces a very heavy penalty for possession of an ivory figurine weighing about six hundred grams. Brondi, who is well known among the Italians stationed in Watamu and considered a decent person who has found like many in Kenya a place to relax and enjoy a prolonged vacation, was stopped a few days ago upon arrival at Mombasa's MOI International Airport with the valuable ivory necklace and, after being detained by local authorities, admitted that he was its owner and that he had brought it especially from Italy but that since it was a worked object (with a sculpture depicting himself, as reported by the TV channel K24 news site with an estimated value of 17 thousand euros) he did not think it was a crime. In fact, Kenya punishes the possession and trafficking of ivory, both with regard to elephant tusks or pieces of them, and with regard to worked and semi-processed items that are not properly reported and have certificates attesting to their age and provenance. Already in the past, there have been cases of seizures and fines for those who failed to report historical hunting trophies or other wildlife relics (including ivory), and the Kenya Wildlife Service had issued an ultimatum to all owners of objects or parts of land or sea animal species that it is illegal to capture and possess (except precisely for ancient objects duly reported in times of no suspicion). Now Brondi, who has already appeared a first time before Mombasa Judge Martin Rabera and pleaded guilty to the charge of possessing a trophy wildlife of endangered species, contrary to Section 92 (4) of the Wildlife Conservation and Management Act, will have to appear in court hearings in Mombasa to explain exactly how and where he got that ivory in the hope that Kenyan authorities will understand his good faith and his terrible naivetÃ© that led him to ignore not only Kenyan but international laws. Because the penalties for detaining and trafficking ivory can carry up to 20 years in prison.

TAWAU: Sepasang suami isteri masing-masing didenda sebanyak RM100,000 dan penjara empat tahun selepas mengaku bersalah atas pertuduhan memiliki empat batang gading gajah Borneo secara haram, di Mahkamah Sesyen, di sini hari ini.
Tertuduh Hendrikus Pale, 48, dan isterinya Anastasia Daton, 50, didakwa melakukan kesalahan itu pada 5 Januari lalu, pukul 1.30 petang di rumah pekerja Ladang Maliau Serijaya Industries Sdn Bhd dalam kawasan Hutan Simpan Gunung Rara (kelas II), dalam daerah Kalabakan-Tawau.
Berdasarkan pertuduhan yang dibacakan dihadapan Hakim Awang Kerisnada Awang Mahmud, kedua-dua tertuduh didakwa dengan niat telah memiliki atau bersubahat memiliki gading gajah berkenaan iaitu suatu hasil daripada spesis haiwan yang dilindungi sepenuhnya seperti mana disenaraikan dalam Bahagian 1, Jadual 1, Nombor 11 Enakmen Pemeliharaan Hidupan Liar 1997 tanpa kebenaran bertulis dari menteri yang bertindak atas nasihat pengarah.
Sehubungan itu, tertuduh didakwa melakukan kesalahan mengikut Seksyen 41 (1) Enakmen Pemeliharaan Hidupan Liar 1997 dan boleh dihukum dibawah Seksyen 41(1)(a) Enakmen yang sama dibacakan bersama Seksyen 34 Kanun Keseksaan.
Jika sabit kesalahan, tertuduh boleh dikenakan hukuman denda antara RM50,000 hingga RM250,000 dan penjara antara satu hingga lima tahun.
Pendakwaan dilakukan Pegawai Pendakwa Jabatan Hidupan Liar (JHL) Abdul Karim Dakog manakala tertuduh tidak diwakili peguam.
Terdahulu, kedua-dua tertuduh merayu mahkamah agar meringankan hukuman memandangkan mereka perlu menyara anak yang kini berada di kampung, Indonesia.
Abdul Karim dalam hujahnya berkata, pemilikan empat gading itu memerlukan sekurang-kurangnya dua ekor gajah Borneo mati dibunuh.
Malah menurutnya, gajah Borneo adalah haiwan yang dilindungi dan menjadi satu kesalahan besar jika memiliki gading tanpa kebenaran di negeri ini
Awang Kerisnada berkata, mahkamah tidak boleh mengenakan hukuman yang ringan bagi kesalahan tersebut kerana mengambil kira kes, kepupusan haiwan dan kepentingan awam.
â€œGajah Borneo adalah spesis dilindungi dan hampir pupus. Justeru, saya mahukan hukuman yang dikenakan ini memberi mesej yang cukup jelas kepada orang ramai betapa seriusnya kesalahan ini sekali gus tidak melakukannya.
â€œApatah lagi, tertuduh adalah warga asing yang bekerja di sini, sanggup melanggar perundangan negara ini,â€ katanya.
Beliau menjelaskan, aktiviti membunuh gajah Borneo yang semakin meningkat di Sabah berlaku disebabkan adanya mereka (tertuduh) sebagai pembeli dan mengambil untung daripada hasil jualan semula gading tersebut.
â€œSehubungan itu, mahkamah memutuskan setiap tertuduh dikenakan hukuman denda sebanyak RM100,000 dan penjara 4 tahun bermula hari ini.
â€œSelain itu, jika gagal membayar denda, mereka akan dipenjara selama setahun dan hukuman itu dijalankan secara berasingan dengan hukuman penjara sedia ada,â€ katanya.
Awang Kerisnada berkata, kedua-dua tertuduh juga hendaklah diserahkan kepada Jabatan Imigresen Malaysia (JIM) untuk tujuan pengusiran selepas tamat menjalani hukuman penjara, selain semua gading yang dirampas diserahkan kepada JHL bagi tujuan perlupusan mengikut perundangan.
Sementara itu, sebaik selesai prosiding mahkamah, Hendrikus kelihatan sebak dan mula sedikit hilang pertimbangan dipercayai akibat tidak berpuas hati dengan hukuman tersebut.
Kekecohan berlaku apabila Hendrikus mula bertindak agresif dan menjerit ke arah pegawai JHL yang mengawalnya.
Pihak polis dan pegawai JHL terpaksa mengambil masa hampir 10 minit untuk menenangkan tertuduh sebelum dia dan isterinya dibawa keluar dari pekarangan mahkamah ke penjara untuk menjalani hukuman.

Loose English translation
TAWAU: A husband and wife were each fined RM100,000 and jailed for four years after pleading guilty to the charge of illegally possessing four Borneo elephant tusks, at the Sessions Court, here today.
Accused Hendrikus Pale, 48, and his wife Anastasia Daton, 50, were charged with committing the offense on January 5, at 1.30pm at the home of Ladang Maliau Serijaya Industries Sdn Bhd workers in the Gunung Rara Forest Reserve (class II), in the Kalabakan-Tawau district. .

Based on the charges that were read before Judge Awang Kerisnada Awang Mahmud, the two accused were charged with the intention of possessing or conspiring to possess the elephant tusks in question, which is a product of a fully protected animal species as listed in Part 1, Table 1, Number 11 of the Wildlife Conservation Enactment Wild 1997 without the written permission of the minister acting on the advice of the director.
Accordingly, the accused is charged with committing an offense under Section 41 (1) of the Wildlife Conservation Enactment 1997 and can be punished under Section 41(1)(a) of the same Enactment read with Section 34 of the Penal Code.

If convicted, the accused can be fined between RM50,000 and RM250,000 and imprisoned between one and five years.
The prosecution was carried out by the Prosecuting Officer of the Wildlife Department (JHL) Abdul Karim Dakog while the accused was not represented by a lawyer.
Earlier, the two accused appealed to the court to lighten the sentence considering that they have to support their children who are now in the village, Indonesia.
Abdul Karim in his argument said that the ownership of the four tusks required at least two Borneo elephants to be killed.
In fact, according to him, Borneo elephants are protected animals and it is a big offense to have tusks without permission in this state
Awang Kerisnada said, the court cannot impose a light sentence for the offense because it takes into account the case, the extinction of animals and the public interest.
""The Borneo elephant is a protected species and is on the verge of extinction. Therefore, I want the punishment imposed to give a clear enough message to the public how serious this offense is so as not to do it.

""What's more, the accused is a foreigner working here, willing to violate the laws of this country,"" he said.
He explained that the increasing killing of Borneo elephants in Sabah is due to them (the accused) being buyers and profiting from the resale of the tusks.
""Accordingly, the court ruled that each accused be fined RM100,000 and imprisoned for 4 years starting today.
""In addition, if they fail to pay the fine, they will be imprisoned for a year and the sentence will be carried out separately from the existing prison sentence,"" he said.
Awang Kerisnada said the two accused should also be handed over to the Malaysian Immigration Department (JIM) for the purpose of deportation after serving their prison sentences, in addition to all confiscated ivory being handed over to JHL for disposal in accordance with the law.
Meanwhile, as soon as the court proceedings were over, Hendrikus looked tearful and began to lose his judgment a little, believed to be due to his dissatisfaction with the sentence.

A commotion broke out when Hendrikus started acting aggressively and yelling at the JHL officers who were guarding him.
The police and JHL officers had to take nearly 10 minutes to calm the accused before he and his wife were taken out of the court yard to prison to serve their sentence.

The Indonesian police have arrested two alleged killers of protected Sumatran elephants and been hunting another person for alleged involvement in the case. The suspects sold the tusks and other body parts of the elephants (elephas maximus sumatranus) they hunted in Riau province, the Indragiri Hulu District, Police's Chief Efrizal SIK said on Monday. The two persons were captured in the province and nearby North Sumatra province last month with scores of evidence including the skulls of elephants, a pair of tusks and assembled weapons, said the police officer. The two persons have long been implicated in poaching of endangered giant mammals, he said. They were involved in the killing of Sumatran elephants in the districts of Palalawan and Bengkalis in Riau province in 2015, said Efrizal. Under the law, the suspects shall face a five-year jail term and pay fines if found guilty, local media reported. The Sumatran elephant is a sub-species of Asian elephant which is extremely rare. The number of the Sumatran elephants just reached around 2,000 based on the prediction in 2000. The animals are found exclusively in the Sumatra Island, but their population has severely drifted down as they lost more than 80 percent of habitat due to deforestation.

Though the accused managed to dodge the sleuths for some time, they were caught red-handed. The carved ivory includes an idol of Lord Krishna with his flute. The idol is placed on a wooden pedestal. The remaining two are one-and-a-half foot dexterously carved tusks. The workmanship is so perfect that the tusks stand out as a milky white 3-D sculpture.

Rwanda Investigation Bureau (RIB) has in custody four people held for allegedly trafficking products from endangered animals such as elephant ivory. They were caught while using Rwanda as a transit country to smuggle 45 kilogrammes of ivory from the Democratic Republic of Congo to Asian countries, according to RIB Spokesperson Thierry
Murangira. The illicit merchandise was transported in a Toyota double cabin which had diplomatic number plates. The destination countries were not specified. The suspects include two Rwandans â€“ one of them working with a regional body which earned him diplomatic status â€“ one Burundian and a Congolese national. Desire Murokozi, who is the head of finance at the regional power development firm SINELAC, and Derrick Gisa, are the two Rwandans while Cyriaque Kaburaburyo, is the Burundian national, and
Nicodem Bagabo, Congolese. The quartet however does not agree on the account of the events. According to one version, a one Gideon Imanishimwe who is the alleged â€˜bossâ€™ and remains at large, got in contact with Murokozi and interested him in the deal. The deal was to transport ivory from DR Congo and transit through Rwanda to the Asian market. According to Kaburaburyo and Bagabo, the 45 kgs were given as a sample to Imanishimwe who had earlier requested for a larger consignment. They were intercepted on their way to Kigali from DR Congo via the Rusizi border. The Burundian national claims to have put in touch the ivory owner based in DR Congo with Murokozi, but claims he was not part of the negotiations and only accompanied the latter because he was his boss. On the other hand, Bagabo said he travelled to Kigali to get the payment from Imanishimwe, which he would then take back to the ivory owner in DR Congo. However, Murokozi denies knowing anything about it, saying he only offered the trio a lift in his car from Rusizi to Kigali. ""I had no idea what was in their bags, and I was not involved in their business,"" he explained. According to Murangira, the four were arrested last week on Friday and they were still looking for their collaborators, including Imanishimwe. ""Any individual who hunts sells, injures, or kills a protected animal species or its products commits an offense,"" Murangira declared, citing Rwandan Law on Environment NÂ°48/2018 in its article 58. ""It is not only a crime in Rwanda, but it is also a violation of the international treaty on the protection of endangered species,"" he continued, adding that Rwanda should not be used a transit of illicit merchandise. Murangira said that the four are detained at Kicukiro RIB station pending conclusion of investigations, after which they will be handed over to prosecution. Upon conviction, they risk a sentence of not less than five years and not more than seven years in prison, as well as a fine of between Rwf5 million and 7 million.

Rigorous enforcement of environmental laws is therefore needed to discourage traffickers and enhance the natural resources of protected areas. It is strongly hoped that the Ministry of Living Environment and Sustainable Development and its structures under supervision will make a particular follow-up for this case so that these three alleged traffickers are severely punished.

Baripada Forest Division officials have arrested five persons on the charge of smuggling two elephant tusks near Titia Chhak under the forest division in Mayurbhanj district. An official said that one of the tusks measured 45-cm-long and weighed 700 gram while the other one was 38-cm-long and weighed 600 gram. The tusks had been removed from an eight-nine-year-old baby elephant. The tusks, estimated to cost around Rs 50,000 to Rs 70,000 each, were being smuggled to West Bengal, the official said. The accused were Debendranath Mahali, Jagannath Sigh, Pankaj Kumar Mahali, Binu Singh from Uparataladiha village and Sushant Singh of Jamudiha village under the Udala police station. Honorary Wildlife Warden Bhanumitra Acharya said the seized tusks date back to one to two years. â€œAs a tusker carcass has not been seized in past one or two years, it is suspected that poachers might have killed the elephant in the Similipal core area or hid its carcass somewhere to extract the tusks,â€ he added.

The Main Customs Office in the town of Loerrach, which is also located in the south-western German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, a few miles down the road from Weil am Rhein, said in a statement released on Thursday, August 18 and obtained by Zenger News: â€œAt the beginning of February this year, officials at the Weil am Rhein customs office seized a real elephantâ€™s foot, which had been converted into a container, in a postal item.â€ The customs officials added that the package had been posted from England and was intended for a Swiss person who had had it shipped to a German pick-up address. They said: â€œThe package was posted in England and was intended for a recipient in Switzerland who had had the shipment delivered to a German pick-up address. â€œThe customs clearance was therefore carried out at the customs office in Weil am Rhein.â€ The customs officials explained that African elephants (Loxodonta) are a protected species, adding: â€œThe appraisal by an expert showed that it was the foot of an African elephant. According to the Federal Nature Conservation Act, elephants are an animal species that is particularly strictly protected and is still highly endangered due to the hunt for ivory, the marketing of which is prohibited in principle.â€ They called the item â€œtastelessâ€ and said that the recipient did not have the necessary paperwork to import such an item. They said: â€œThe recipient was unable to present the documents required for importing the tasteless gift.â€ Maya Jehle, of the customs office in Loerrach, said: â€œThe foot was completely hollowed out from the inside and damaged on top with a red velvet cover and golden fringes. Itâ€™s totally tasteless.â€ Officials at the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation in Bonn are now handling the investigation, which is ongoing.

On January 9, five men were arrested in Ntulele, Narok county, while ferrying 32.9 kilos of elephant tusks worth about Sh3 million. The five had concealed six pieces of the tusks in a sack of charcoal. They were using two motorcycles to transport the tusks when they were stopped by Kenya Wildlife Service personnel and police. Police said the men were under interrogation after an initial appearance in court to reveal the source of the tusks. But it seems they had killed at least three elephants to get the tusks, which they said were to be delivered in Nairobi. Police said they expected more arrests in the probe. â€œThe trade in tusks is illegal and everyone should know this. We will investigate further to get all players involved,â€ police spokesperson Dr Resla Onyango said.

A large number of wildlife products, such as animal skins and taxidermy, were seized in raids carried out in clandestine workshops in San Justo and Florencio Varela. Two people were arrested during the proceedings. Authorities believe that these places hide behind a network of poachers and trafficking of animals of protected species. Among the seized material were heads and skins of deer and antelope of different species, African lion, tirica cat, pumas and African elephant hides. In addition, in one of the raided workshops they found a hippopotamus in the process of tanning. Some pieces were found taxidermied and others frozen, ready to be subjected to this process. The seized material was taken for safekeeping to the Bernardino Rivadavia Museum of Natural Sciences by order of the intervening court, within the framework of the case for violation of the Wildlife Conservation Law. As a result of the operations, two people were arrested, who were charged with not having all the documentation that supports the legitimate possession of the pieces. The procedures, carried out by members of the Environmental Control Brigade (BCA), under the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, are part of the actions that the ministry led by Juan CabandiÃ© carries out against the illegal trade of wildlife. The raid was ordered by the Federal Court of Quilmes and carried out by the BCA in conjunction with the Environmental Crimes Department of the Argentine Federal Police.

Dutch law officials seized several elephant tusks worth tens of thousands of euros in a probe into illegal ivory smuggling, police said on Thursday. In their latest haul, police and customs officers intercepted 85 kilogrammes (187 pounds) of ivory, valued at around 50,000 euros ($52,000) in the port city of Rotterdam. â€œWe are suspecting illegal organised trading in ivory,â€ police said, after opening a probe earlier this year. The investigation was triggered when a postal company noted a large and suspicious package containing a wooden crate.  Inside, police found a single tusk â€” which had been sent for forensic analysis. Other subsequent shipments have been intercepted, police said.  They did not say where the tusks were coming from or going to but added environmental agents from a police team dealing with Indonesia was participating in the investigation.

In an international investigation into the ivory trade, the police have seized several elephant tusks. The more than 85 kilos of ivory has a value of more than 50,000 euros, reports the police. The investigation started a few months ago, when a postal company in the Rotterdam area received a package that looked suspicious. It was a large wooden box. When it was opened, they found a large elephant tusk. The trade in raw ivory is prohibited in Europe and therefore the find was reported to customs. Customs had the tusk examined in a laboratory. Research was done on the origin of the ivory and the age determined. Customs then called in team Milieu Rotterdam, after which an investigation was started under the direction of a public prosecutor. The aim of the research is to map out exactly which way the ivory travels and which persons and companies are involved in this trade. ""It is suspected that there is structural trade in ivory. Several shipments have already been intercepted,"" writes the police. The police did not disclose how many shipments are involved. The research will continue in the coming period. Arrests are not excluded.

Three suspected traffickers of elephant ivory were arrested on Saturday 1er July 2023 in Yamoussoukro, the political capital of CÃ´te d'Ivoire with six elephant tusks weighing 42 kg. They were arrested as they were about to sell their hunting trophies in a city wall. The arrests were made possible thanks to the collaboration between the Unit for the Fight against Transnational Organized Crime (UCT), the Directorate of Forest and Water Police of the Ministry of Water and Forests (DPFE-MINEF) and EAGLE-CÃ´te d'Ivoire, from which they received technical assistance. It was in the early afternoon of the 1ster July 2023 that the men of the UCT, the DPFE-MINEF with the technical support of EAGLE â€“ CÃ´te d'Ivoire, an NGO specialized in the fight against the trafficking of protected wild animal species arrived in the city of Yamoussoukro where three alleged traffickers of elephant ivory were holed up. The assault was carried out just as they were about to sell their contraband. The three traffickers were arrested with six elephant ivory spikes in their possession, two of which belonged to an adult elephant and four to two calves. The six ivories were transported from MÃ©agui, a town in southwestern CÃ´te d'Ivoire, to be sold illegally in Yamoussoukro. According to the investigation, the six ivories seized are the result of elephant poaching in the TaÃ¯ National Park, where only about a hundred are believed to remain. This version of events is supported by Colonel Diarrassouba Abdoulaye, director of the Ivorian Office of Parks and Reserves (OIPR) in the south-west zone of the country, who specifies that the two large elephant spikes weighing 38 kg were removed from an adult male elephant well known from the files of his service. Indeed, this male elephant weighing nearly 4 tons was receiving special attention from wildlife conservationists. ""He was the biggest pachyderm in TaÃ¯ National Park. He was seen every two weeks in the area. It was harmless and commanded admiration. "", says Colonel Diarrassouba, for whom the loss of this elephant is a great loss for his protected area and for CÃ´te d'Ivoire. ""We call on park residents to be cooperative with animals. We are the ones who are encroaching on their territory. We need to think of animals as our friends. "" said the senior wildlife officer. ""At the beginning of 2023, this elephant had even received a visit from an American team from North Carolina (USA) to place a GPS bracelet on it. The operation failed and was scheduled to resume in November 2023. Since then, there has been no trace of the elephant until the seizure of its ivory in Yamoussoukro on the 1ster July 2023. Arrested for the illegal possession, circulation and marketing of wildlife products, the three ivory traffickers were immediately placed in police custody at the UCT in Abidjan-Cocody. After which, they were referred on July 05, 2023 to the Toumodi Court Section. The case was put in flagrante delicto proceedings and the suspects were placed under a detention order. If the three smugglers are found guilty, they risk a prison sentence ranging from 2 to 12 months and a fine of 3000 to 300,000 CFA francs according to article No. 65-255 of 4 August 1965 relating to the protection of wildlife and the exercise of hunting. The international ivory trade has been illegal since 1989, but African elephant populations continue to decline. Every year, 20,000 to 30,000 elephants are killed for their ivory, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF); equivalent to between 50 and 80 individuals per day. There are only 415,000 pachyderms left in Africa, down from 3 to 5 million at the beginning of the last century. In CÃ´te d'Ivoire, elephants, the country's emblem, are on the verge of extinction: their numbers have halved in thirty years. More than 1139 were counted in 26 habitats according to reports made between 1987 and 2000. Today, the number of individuals barely exceeds 300, according to a 2016 report by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

It was during a punch operation, carried out by agents of the regional delegation of Forests and Wildlife of the Center, in collaboration with the regional division of the Judicial Police, that the two alleged traffickers were arrested in Yaounde. The two traffickers were apprehended in downtown YaoundÃ© while trying to sell elephant tusks. They were found with two whole tusks and 12 huge pieces of ivory hidden among clothing in a suitcase. The elephant tusks weighed nearly 60 kg. The suspects were remanded to YaoundÃ©-Kondengui central prison. A Wildlife Law Enforcement Support Organization (LAGA), provided technical assistance during this operation. According to a source who wished to remain anonymous, the two suspects belong to a vast network of traffickers which extends in the sub-region and as far as Nigeria. They specialize in the trafficking of many wildlife species, including elephant tusks and feline skins. The source also added that the elephant tusks come from Congo and the network uses heavy-duty storage crates to transport these wildlife products from one country to another. Under the Wildlife Act 1994, anyone found at any time and anywhere, in possession of all or part of a protected species, is deemed to have killed the animal. Strict enforcement of this law is therefore necessary to stem the extinction of elephants in the country and in the region. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the elephant population, particularly the African forest elephant, is in steep decline due to poaching. Ofir Drori, founding director of the Eco Activists for Governance and Law Enforcement (EAGLE Network) said the poaching situation in the sub-region is serious, especially in northern Congo and south-eastern Cameroon. This iconic animal faces a serious threat, due to its ivory, and is on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. Elephants play a very important role in our ecosystem and many environmental scientists say urgent action is needed, as IUCN Director General Dr Bruno Oberle said: â€œWe urgently need to put an end to poaching and ensure that we conserve adequate habitat, sufficient for forest and savannah elephants. Several African countries have shown the way in recent years, proving that we can reverse the decline of elephants, and we must work together so that their example can be followed.""

Soon after they arrived, the arresting team moved in and apprehended them. The contraband was concealed in Briqueterie, a notorious neighbourhood in Yaounde known for wildlife trafficking and other dangerous criminal activities. The traffickers belong to a trafficking ring operating in major ivory trafficking hotspots in the country and especially in a town close to the border with Gabon and Equatorial Guinea. The traffickers are linked to Abdoul Salami, arrested in 2021 with 2 tons of pangolin scales and leopard skins. The ring operates in Congo, Gabon, Nigeria and beyond. Close relatives attempted to free the traffickers by applying pressure on wildlife officials but the attempts were combated.

Three suspected traffickers of elephant ivory were arrested on Saturday 1er July 2023 in Yamoussoukro, the political capital of CÃ´te d'Ivoire with six elephant tusks weighing 42 kg. They were arrested as they were about to sell their hunting trophies in a city wall. The arrests were made possible thanks to the collaboration between the Unit for the Fight against Transnational Organized Crime (UCT), the Directorate of Forest and Water Police of the Ministry of Water and Forests (DPFE-MINEF) and EAGLE-CÃ´te d'Ivoire, from which they received technical assistance. It was in the early afternoon of the 1ster July 2023 that the men of the UCT, the DPFE-MINEF with the technical support of EAGLE â€“ CÃ´te d'Ivoire, an NGO specialized in the fight against the trafficking of protected wild animal species arrived in the city of Yamoussoukro where three alleged traffickers of elephant ivory were holed up. The assault was carried out just as they were about to sell their contraband. The three traffickers were arrested with six elephant ivory spikes in their possession, two of which belonged to an adult elephant and four to two calves. The six ivories were transported from MÃ©agui, a town in southwestern CÃ´te d'Ivoire, to be sold illegally in Yamoussoukro. According to the investigation, the six ivories seized are the result of elephant poaching in the TaÃ¯ National Park, where only about a hundred are believed to remain. This version of events is supported by Colonel Diarrassouba Abdoulaye, director of the Ivorian Office of Parks and Reserves (OIPR) in the south-west zone of the country, who specifies that the two large elephant spikes weighing 38 kg were removed from an adult male elephant well known from the files of his service. Indeed, this male elephant weighing nearly 4 tons was receiving special attention from wildlife conservationists. ""He was the biggest pachyderm in TaÃ¯ National Park. He was seen every two weeks in the area. It was harmless and commanded admiration. "", says Colonel Diarrassouba, for whom the loss of this elephant is a great loss for his protected area and for CÃ´te d'Ivoire. ""We call on park residents to be cooperative with animals. We are the ones who are encroaching on their territory. We need to think of animals as our friends. "" said the senior wildlife officer. ""At the beginning of 2023, this elephant had even received a visit from an American team from North Carolina (USA) to place a GPS bracelet on it. The operation failed and was scheduled to resume in November 2023. Since then, there has been no trace of the elephant until the seizure of its ivory in Yamoussoukro on the 1ster July 2023. Arrested for the illegal possession, circulation and marketing of wildlife products, the three ivory traffickers were immediately placed in police custody at the UCT in Abidjan-Cocody. After which, they were referred on July 05, 2023 to the Toumodi Court Section. The case was put in flagrante delicto proceedings and the suspects were placed under a detention order. If the three smugglers are found guilty, they risk a prison sentence ranging from 2 to 12 months and a fine of 3000 to 300,000 CFA francs according to article No. 65-255 of 4 August 1965 relating to the protection of wildlife and the exercise of hunting. The international ivory trade has been illegal since 1989, but African elephant populations continue to decline. Every year, 20,000 to 30,000 elephants are killed for their ivory, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF); equivalent to between 50 and 80 individuals per day. There are only 415,000 pachyderms left in Africa, down from 3 to 5 million at the beginning of the last century. In CÃ´te d'Ivoire, elephants, the country's emblem, are on the verge of extinction: their numbers have halved in thirty years. More than 1139 were counted in 26 habitats according to reports made between 1987 and 2000. Today, the number of individuals barely exceeds 300, according to a 2016 report by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

The 4.5 kg wildlife trophies that were nabbed from the suspects are worth a street value of Sh2.95 million. The accused through their lawyers pleaded to be released on bond or bail citing that they remain innocent until proven guilty. However, their prayers were vehemently objected to by the prosecution on account of the grave nature of the charges. â€œI have read the six pre-bail reports all six accused are said to have a permanent place of abode.

Two herders accused of illegally possessing elephant tusks have been given stringent bond terms of Sh1 million each after being charged. The two were arraigned before Mombasa chief magistrate Martha Mutuku on Wednesday. They were accused of dealing in ivory and allegedly found with Sh2 million worth of elephant tusks by Kenya Wildlife Service detectives. The court declined to remand them but imposed hefty bond terms of Sh1 million each, with two personal sureties and an alternative Sh1 million cash bail. The prosecution through principal prosecuting counsel Alex Gituma had opposed their release on bond after the investigation officer stated that the two could abscond trial. The accused were also said to have no place of abode with the investigator stating they are herders, who continuously migrate with their animals in search of pasture and water. However, Mutuku ruled that the charges facing them are bailable but released them on stringent terms to ensure they attend the trial. The two men were charged with dealing in wildlife trophies of an endangered species worth Sh2 million without a permit contrary to Section 92(2) of the Wildlife Conservation Act. They were allegedly jointly found dealing in two (2) pieces of elephant tusk weighing 6 kg concealed in a brownish safari bag without a permit or other lawful exemption. The two allegedly committed the crime on 13 June 13, 2023, in Mwembe Tayari area within Mombasa County. The case has been fixed for pre-trial on 22 June 2023.

Speaking to the press in his office on Friday evening, Busia County Criminal Investigation Officer Benson Omondi said that the illegal items were recovered at Mundika area within Busia Sub County. â€œEarly today, we received a tip-off from members of the public that there were persons in possession of elephant tusks who were searching for a buyer, so we immediately organised a contingent of officers composed of CID team, officers from Busia police station and KWS, and laid an ambush within Mundika,â€ he said. Omondi added that the officers also arrested four suspects who were carrying a gunny bag whose contents were later found to be 10 pieces of elephant tusks with a street value of Sh2.8 million. â€œThe suspects have been placed in police custody pending arraignment on Monday,â€ he said. He urged the local residents to desist from engaging in illegitimate trade, warning that they risked being arrested. â€œWe also urge members of the public to volunteer information, which we will use in confidence in order to secure our County,â€ he said.

Four suspects were on Saturday arrested while trying to sell ten pieces of elephant tusks weighing 28 kilograms in Busia Town. The four were riding on a bodaboda when they were intercepted by police and Kenya Wildlife Service officials who had been tipped off. Upon searching two gunny bags they were ferrying with ten pieces of elephant tusks weighing 28 kilogrames with an estimated street value of Sh2.8 million were recovered, police said. The two men and two women said they were taking the same to a potential buyer when they were intercepted on July 29. The buyer happened to be an undercover detective who had been tipped off about the deal. Police say they are yet to know the source of the tusks. The suspects were Monday, July 31 expected in court as police investigate the source of the tusks. Elephant tusks fetch a fortune in the black market as a surge in demand for ivory in the East continues to fuel the illicit trade in elephant tusks, especially from Africa. Officials say despite a ban on the international trade in ivory, African elephants are still being poached in large numbers. As part of efforts to stop the menace, Kenya has started using high-tech surveillance equipment, including drones, to track poachers and keep tabs on elephants and rhinos. KWS and stakeholders have put in place mechanisms to eradicate all forms of wildlife crime, particularly poaching. hese mechanisms include enhanced community education, interagency collaboration, and intensive intelligence-led operations, among others. These efforts led to zero rhino poaching in Kenya in 2020-the first time in about two decades. At least 20,000 elephants are killed annually in Africa for their ivory. This translates to 55 elephants killed daily or one elephant killed every 26 minutes with a population of 35,000 elephants. On April 30, 2016, Kenya set ablaze 105 tonnes of elephant ivory and 1.35 tonnes of rhino horn. Former President Uhuru Kenyatta led world leaders and conservationists in burning the remains of 6,500 elephants and 450 rhinos killed for their tusks and horn. Parliament has also passed strict anti-poaching laws and the government has beefed up security at parks to stop poaching, which threatens the vital tourism industry. Regionally, Kenya has also emerged as a major transit route for ivory destined for Asian markets from eastern and central Africa. The illegal ivory trade is mostly fuelled by demand in Asia and the Middle East, where elephant tusks and rhino horns are used to make ornaments and traditional medicines.

As per reports, five persons who were in possession of various animal bones, an elephant tusk, a deer antler, and other body parts were arrested by forest officials on Friday. While speaking to media, Sandeep Kumar, Assam's Chief Wildlife Warden said that an intelligence-based operation led to correct tracking that further resulted in the retrieval of the articles and detention of the persons involved.

Qi Zihua had checked in with Ethiopian Airways and was en route to Beijing, China. His bag was intercepted by airport security during a routine inspection of passenger luggage. Upon detection of suspicious products, his bag was searched, and he was found in possession of worked elephant ivory, including ivory bangles, a necklace and other decorative pieces all carved from elephant tusks. Department of National Parks and Wildlife Officers conducted questioning and further investigations. Traditionally, ivory traffickers have smuggled whole or large pieces of elephant tusks out of the country, where they would be processed and worked locally in consumer markets. Recent investigations however have uncovered the alarming trend of ivory being processed in source countries before being smuggled to end markets. It is believed that criminal syndicates have set up shops in African countries in reaction to increased international focus on the illicit ivory trade.

Gujarat seems to have become a hotbed for ivory smuggling in the country. A racket of illegal ivory trade that may amount to crores of rupees was busted by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) and forest department from Vadodara. Four members of the gang arrested were being questioned. Investigation revealed that a large number of ivory idols are being sold across the state in the garb of antique items.  Under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, elephant tusk and the sale of ivory produce are banned in India. Investigators said that the inter-state gang involved in the trade sold the ivory idols under the garb of antique items to elude forest officials. Four persons were arrested from Vadodara while some more arrests are expected from Ahmedabad and Rajkot soo, said forest officials. A kilogram of elephant tusk may cost anywhere between Rs 2-3 lakh in the black market. ""It's a state-wide racket wherein the key accused lure customers on social media. They post photos of the idols under the category of the antique item claiming that they are very rare,"" said Doki Adi Mallaiah, inspector, WCCB, western zone. During the investigation, WCCB learnt that such ivory idols were being traded in different cities of Gujarat. ""We tracked down one of the key accused Kiran Shah who used to sell the ivory idols in Vadodara. A decoy customer was first sent to gather more details and then Shah's shop was raided. We found many ivory idols there,"" Mallaiah told TOI. WCCB, the forest department and GSPCA (Gujarat Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) had in a joint operation raided a shop owned by Shah and found ivory idols along with two rhino horns in the city. Three other persons were also arrested in connection with the case. Names of the three accused other than Shah were not revealed by the investigators. Further investigations revealed that the gangs poaching elephant tusks smuggle them to artists in West Bangal and Rajasthan. There artists carve idols of gods, goddesses and other objects from the ivory that then makes its way to Gujarat. ""Traders in Gujarat sell these ivory idols. Many are also involved in money laundering and we may book those arrested under the concerned act,"" he added.

The recent interception of a 20-foot container with 651 pieces of elephant ivory at the port of Maputo, Mozambique, is evidence that criminal networks driving the illegal wildlife trade remain a threat to global conservation efforts. It is critical that a thorough investigation take place, including using forensic science to assist in determining the potential geographic origin of these tusks, which likely extends beyond Mozambique into other elephant range states in southern or East Africa. Close cooperation between governments around the world will be essential to unravel this network. Itâ€™s also important to secure official stockpiles of ivory and ensure that there is no leakage from these sources. The vigilance of SERNIC and the Mozambican Tax Authority is to be applauded. This is a timely reminder that consumer demand for ivory remains in many countries, and the resolve of the global community to secure a viable future for Africaâ€™s elephants must remain strong.

A joint task force in Mozambique has seized a shipping container containing 651 pieces of ivory hidden among sacks of corn, reports say. The shipment was bound for Dubai, however the UAE has no domestic market for ivory, according to its government. Instead, it serves as a transit point in order to circumvent efforts to crack down on the trafficking of ivory from Africa to East Asia. The operation comes nearly six years since the last major seizure by Mozambican authorities of 3,354 kilograms of ivory, also secreted away in a shipping container in Maputo, the countryâ€™s biggest port. The pieces found this month amount to less than 2,000 kilograms. The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) applauded the joint task force behind the seizure, which comprised officials from the National Investigation Service and the Mozambican Tax Authority. The IFAW also called for a thorough investigation, noting that such a large shipment of ivory was â€œevidence that the criminal network driving the illegal wildlife trade remains a threat to global conservation efforts.â€

A shipping container with 651 pieces of elephant tusks en route to Dubai was intercepted at Maputo port on the 22nd of March by Mozambique's Criminal Investigation Service (SERNIC) in conjunction with the nation's Tax Authority (AT). 

According to local press, the tusks were hidden in the center of the container and surrounded by bags of corn. X-rays of the container at the port revealed the existence of the tusks and an investigation into the owner of the container as well as the customs broker is underway. 

A wildlife crime expert speaking to Mozambique Bio stated, ""Based on the photos I had access to, and given the quality of the ivory, it must be not only from Mozambique, but also from organized crime in neighboring countries.""

The Details:

According to the Environment Investigation Agency, Mozambique is a 'safe-haven' for Chinese and Vietnamese organizations involved in the ivory trade. The country's corruption, lack of protection of government ivory stockpiles, lack of inter-agency cooperation, and lenient penalties for those caught trafficking ivory, enables the illegal industry to boom in Mozambique. 

Additionally, with Dubai acting only as a transit point for ivory, the tracing of trafficking masterminds becomes more difficult and further complicates any attempt to crack down on poaching and trafficking from Africa.

A document from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Ministry of Climate Change and Environment on the 'Implementation of CITES Provisions Concerning Ivory' states, ""There is no domestic ivory market in the UAE, therefore, illegal ivory confiscated in the UAE is meant for transit and doesn't target the local market as there is no demand. It passes to other countries with demand for ivory. Therefore, most of the ivory confiscated in the UAE or in the country of destination passing through the UAE can be detected with the passengers as personal belongings or air to air. Given the internationally adopted procedures, the rule of customs and airlines in air to air passing shipments is limited to tasks that are agreed upon internationally to ease the flow of air traffic. Hence detecting these illegal shipments is more successful in countries of destinations or countries of source, as customs plays a much bigger role.""

CITES, or the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, is a convention in which 184 states are members, resulting in the regulation of trade in 38,000 species.

On April 1, a representative of Hai Phong Customs Department said that the department had seized a large-scale ivory smuggling case. The smuggled ivories were hidden in cargo container imported at Lach Huyen International Port (Hai Phong).

Notably, in order to outsmart detection by enforcement authorities, smugglers painted black these ivory. This is a new trick discovered for the first time in the Hai Phong port and the whole country.

Earlier, following the direction of the leaders of Hai Phong Customs Department, on March 23, the Customs Enforcement Team (Hai Phong Customs Department) coordinated with Dinh Vu Port Border Gate Customs Branch, Economic Police Department (Hai Phong City Police), Team 1 (Anti-Smuggling and Investigation Department, General Department of Vietnam Customs), Reconnaissance Group No. 1 (Vietnam Coast Guard Command) to inspect the suspected cargo container at Lach Huyen International Port.

The enforcement group detected many pineapple sacks containing 547 pieces of ivory with a total weight of 1,580 kg.

During the investigation process, the Customs force discovered signs that the company named on the bill of lading (located in Lang Son) was a bogus company.

Customs News continues to update information about the case.

Wildlife Justice Commission; 2024-05-24
In a landmark joint operation, the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), supported by the Wildlife Justice Commission has successfully arrested two major wildlife traffickers in Nigeria. These arrests are linked to the significant seizure of 1.58 tonnes of ivory at Lach Huyen International Port, Hai Phong, Vietnam on 27 March 2024. Comprehensive intelligence-led investigations by the Wildlife Justice Commission in response to the Hai Phong seizure led to the identification and location of both the alleged shipper and supplier of the ivory. This culminated in their swift apprehension by NCS within six weeks of the Vietnamese authorities reporting the seizure. The first suspect was apprehended by NCS on 16 May 2024 in Abia State, southeastern Nigeria. He is believed to be the consignor of the ivory shipment exported from Onne Port, Port Harcourt, Nigeria on 2 November 2023, which was seized in Vietnam. The ivory, painted black and concealed under a cover load of cow horns, was part of an elaborate smuggling operation. The second suspect was arrested in Onitsha, Nigeria by NCS on 17 May 2024. He is suspected of supplying part or all of the 1.58 tonnes of ivory shipped by the first suspect to Hai Phong, Vietnam. â€œThe efficiency in which NCS was able to conduct intensive post-seizure investigations to identify and arrest those responsible for the shipment demonstrates Nigeriaâ€™s commitment to combating wildlife trafficking. To have achieved all this in a matter of weeks following a reported seizure should be recognised and commended as best practiceâ€, said Olivia Swaak-Goldman, Executive Director of the Wildlife Justice Commission.

The OCIU is an elite unit of the Tamil Nadu police which gathers information on criminals and their activities, and has a dossier of several such people and organised crime networks in its database. The unit is, however, seeking help of Tamil Nadu Forest Department to ascertain the age of the elephant from whose body the tusks were extracted and also to find out more specifics regarding the tusk that has been recovered from the arrested person. Sources in Tamil Nadu Forest Department told IANS that they have at present not got any leads but the interrogation of Ram Alagu is being conducted to get more details and to find out the exact people behind this. OCIU, on its interrogation, has found out that Ram Alagu was just a conduit and that he did not know much about the tusk and the whereabouts from where it was procured. The Tamil Nadu Forest Department has already sent a communique to all the forest divisions in the state and neighbouring states like Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Telengana and Karnataka about the seizure of the tusk and the arrest of the person who was carrying the tusks.

The Forest Department received specific inputs about the movement of some people who were likely to make a huge profit from the sale of the two tusks. A senior official said on Monday that the surveillance on the three suspects led to the arrest of Raman, 53, of Pannaikadu, Somasundaram, 49, of Kannivadi and Ganesan, 59, of Palani. Based on the confession of Raman, forest officials discovered that the accused gained entry into the reserve forest area in Balasamudram near Palani to fetch honey in January. As he was moving inside, he spotted a 12-year-old male elephant dead in the forest and took away the two tusks. After a discussion with the other two men, Raman planned to sell them for a huge price to a person through an agent. At this point, the forest officials secured the three men and seized the tusk. The three were booked under various sections of the Wildlife Prevention Act of 1972. Further investigation was on.

Three people were arrested for possession of elephant tusks and attempting to sell them. The tusks were recovered from a dead elephant in a forest area in Dindigul district. Acting on a tip-off, forest department officers posing as buyers reached out to Somasundaram of Kannivadi and Ganesan of Vayalur who claimed to be in possession of two tusks. The two accused tried to negotiate a sale for 1 crore. Officers laid a trap and asked Somasundaram and Ganesan to bring the tusks to Kannivadi. The accused were then rounded up and arrested on Sunday. On investigation, it came to light that Somasundaram and Ganesan had got the two tusks from Ramu of Pannaikadu, hailing from a tribal community. Ramu was engaged in gathering honey from the forest under Palani range, in December last year, when he found a dead elephant. Instead of reporting it to the forest department, he recovered the tusks from the elephant and took them home. For some months, he was unsure of how to sell the tusks before consulting his acquaintance Somasundaram. Somasundaram and Ganesan subsequently got their hands on the tusks and tried to sell them to a buyer for ivory trade and make profit. Subsequently, they were caught.

Two people including a member of the National Police Reserve were Wednesday arrested while trafficking two elephant tusks along Eldama Ravine-Eldoret Road, Baringo County. Police said the two were arrested near Kaptagat Forest with the tusks weighing 14 kilos and valued at Sh1.4 million. They were on a motorcycle when they were intercepted as they ferried the tusks to a buyer in the area in the June 19 incident. Police said the two were marked people in the illegal business. Police said the suspect will be charged with the offence of being in Possession of Wildlife Trophies of Endangered Species Contrary to Section 92(4) of the Wildlife Conservation Management Act 2013. Officials said the seizure shows up to one elephant had been killed and there is a likelihood the incidents happened in the nearby parks.

The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) has raised a red flag over rising cases of ivory trafficking in the last couple of months. This came, as two suspects were arrested in Suswa along the Mai Mahiu-Narok road, and four pieces of ivory worth more than Sh4.8 million recovered. The sting operation by KWS officers came barely a fortnight after two suspects, including a police officer, were nabbed in the same area, ferrying 29 pieces of ivory tusks. In the latest incident, KWS officers had set up a trap when they cornered the duo travelling to Nairobi to deliver the cargo to waiting â€˜customers.â€™ KWS Senior Warden in Naivasha Francis Mutuko said they got wind of some suspects seeking  market for several pieces of ivory in their possession. Mutoko revealed that the suspects had stayed with the tusks for over a year before the investigating officers got a tip off from the public. â€œOur officers acting on a tip off managed to trap the two suspects who were travelling to Nairobi to sell the ivory and arrested them,â€ he said. He decried the rising cases of ivory trafficking, saying that recovery meant that some elephants had been killed. Mutoko said that last month, KWS officers arrested two more suspects in Wanjohi, Nyandarua, ferrying seven pieces of tusks valued at more than Sh3.8 million. â€œWe are deeply disturbed by resurgence of cases of ivory trafficking, which means that some people are killing elephants in different parts of the country,â€ he said. He noted that in all the cases, the suspects had been taken to court and in the latest incident, the two were being interrogated by DCI officers in Naivasha.

Over the weekend, the Focused Conservation team continued to generate successful operations with the seizure of 369 kgs. (814 lbs.) of pangolin scales in Liberia and six (6) large elephant tusks weighing approximately 60 kgs. in Uganda. By working with the Special Wildlife Crime Units in both countries, the FC team was able to assist in the arrest of 5 wildlife traffickers. On Friday the LIberia Special Wildlife Investigations Unit (LSWIU) arrested a suspected regional buyer of pangolin scales who was alleged to have sold wholesale quantities of scales internationally. The pangolin scales seized during the arrest were from the endangered White-bellied pangolin and the vulnerable Black-bellied pangolin. The Uganda Wildlife Crime Unit (UWCU) led a multi-agency operation on Saturday in the remote Amudat region that resulted in the arrest of four (4) subjects who were involved in trafficking large elephant ivory tusks. Through collaboration with partner agencies, the UWCU was able to have a successful and safe operation despite the numerous challenges they faced. As previously noted, Focused Conservation helps in the development and support of sophisticated and trusted Wildlife Crime Units (WCU) and have partnered with Uganda, Nigeria, Kenya, Liberia and South Africa to assist in vetting, training and mentoring these specialized units to disrupt wildlife trafficking networks.

In Gabon, efforts to fight crime related to protected wildlife species have just resulted in new arrests. A joint team of agents from the Water and Forestry Administration and the Judicial Police in the province of OgoouÃ©-Ivindo in northeastern Gabon has just dismantled an ivory trafficking circuit operating in the town of Makokou. A total of four individuals involved in the commercialization of ivory were arrested on April 5 and 6, 2023. The first was arrested with four ivory tips, two of which were whole and two cut into pieces. Overwhelmed by this arrest, he revealed the details of this case. He confirmed that he was the owner of part of the ivory found in his possession. The driver was also arrested at the same time. On April 6, the owner of the severed ivories and another intermediary were arrested in turn. Arrested with the technical assistance of Conservation Justice, all of these suspects are being prosecuted for possession, attempted commercialization, as well as complicity in possession and complicity in attempted commercialization of ivory tips. Articles 390 and 392 of the new Gabonese penal code provide for a prison sentence of up to 10 years and a fine equivalent to five times the market value of the ivory spikes found in their possession. It should be noted that a pair of ivory tips can easily be traded for 22,500 euros, according to estimates by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW).

A wildlife crime charity has smashed a â€œmafia-typeâ€ smuggling ring taking more than Â£95,000-worth of ivory out of Africa. A six-day operation by Conservation Justice, part of the EAGLE Network, and local agency partners in Gabon was described as a â€œsignificant turning point in the relentless fight against the illegal ivory tradeâ€. Operatives for the charity, as well the Provincial Directorate of Water and Forestry and the Anti-Poaching Directorate of Gabonâ€™s Moyen-OgoouÃ© province, discovered the ivory hidden in secret compartments in a truck. The tusks are believed to have come from forest elephants and represent at least nine slaughtered animals. In total, 19 elephant tusks and four pieces of ivory weighing a total of 120kg were recovered. In China a kilogram of ivory is worth around 1,000 US dollars. The shipment also held 18 rounds of 458 caliber hunting ammunition which could be used to shoot and kill elephants. More than Â£1,000 in cash was also discovered. Approximately seven people were arrested in the operation including several â€œkey playersâ€, according to Luc Mathot, founding director of the NGO Conservation Justice. He said: â€œThis type of operation is vital and should be repeated to dismantle the few large ivory trafficking networks that have managed to survive in Gabon, where the political will to protect the environment remains strong. â€œThe forest elephant population is estimated at 95,000 and appears to be stable, making it their last big refuge. But the pressure remains, particularly from Cameroon.â€ From Cameroon the ivory is exported out of Africa to countries like China, as well as Europe and the US. According to Conservation Justice, the smuggling networks provide funds, ammunition and facilitates to transport the ivory from elephants killed by organised poachers, posing a serious threat to the survival of elephants and national security. Vehicles fitted with secret compartments are used to conceal the ivory and evade controls. More than a dozen people could be involved, with ivory drop-off points spread across various provinces of Gabon. The charity said â€œorganised mafia-type networksâ€ are prepared to do anything to enrich themselves. Ofir Drori, founder of the EAGLE network, which is active in a dozen countries including Cameroon and Gabon said: â€œThe illegal wildlife trade is routed in corruption. This is a good example for that of a very criminal network driving elephants to extinction. ""It has already been caught once and rewarded with a ridiculous sentence only to continue their illegal activities undisturbed. One of the main leaders of the network was sentenced in Cameroon to a ridiculously low prison term despite being arrested with more than 600kg of ivory in 2020. And their illegal activities have continued undisturbed.â€

The operation involved the Gabonese judicial police and government directorates of forestry and wildlife, with the support of the NGO Conservation Justice. In early August, police in the province of Moyen-OgoouÃ© arrested a Gabonese man of Cameroonian origin, along with his wife. A search of their vehicle revealed a cache of 19 tusks and four pieces of ivory, weighing a total of 120kg. For context, 19 tusks mean at least nine elephants had been killed. The search also led to the confiscation of several rifle cartridges used for shooting big game, nearly 1 million CFA francs (about 1,500 euros) in cash, illicit substances and an expired residence permit belonging to a well-known Cameroonian ivory trafficker, according to Stephan Ekore Eko, an anti-poaching specialist at Gabon's Ministry of Water and Forests. Using fresh information from the suspect, the investigators were able to track down more traffickers. A total of ten people were arrested in separate locations, and nine of them were charged with involvement in â€œinternational ivory traffickingâ€, according to Jean Donald Ulrich Mbadinga, a legal expert with Conservation Justice. He said it took ten days for the operation to unravel the â€œvast network of international ivory traffickers in Gabonâ€. â€œThe ivory is taken from Gabon, is trafficked across the border to Cameroon, and from Cameroon to Nigeria and from Nigeria to the Asian market,â€ he said in a video sent to RFI. He explained that the network functioned like a pyramid: â€œAt the top, there is a leader who resides in Cameroon, and this leader works with collaborators who can be divided into two categories: the poachersâ€™ canvassers and the transporters.â€ Canvassers comb the whole of Gabon in search of villagers who can kill elephants, Mbadinga explained. Then when the ivory is available, transporters to go with the canvassers to collect it. The ivory is then transported to Cameroon, he said. â€œThis type of operation is vital and should be repeated to dismantle the few large ivory trafficking networks that have managed to survive in Gabon, where the political will to protect the environment remains strong,â€ says Luc Mathot, founding director of  Conservation Justice.

9 traffickers arrested with 21 elephant tusks weighing 131 kg in a crackdown on a major ivory trafficking ring using hidden compartments in vehicles. The seizure of 21 tusks and 4 ivory pieces is a mere snapshot of the regular activities of this vast network operating for many years with representatives and stations spread all over Gabon, Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon, trafficking ivory between Central and West Africa.

This network, that is estimated to have generated the killings of thousands of elephants, demonstrates that corruption is the main enabler of organized wildlife trafficking. One of its heads has been arrested in Cameroon 3 years ago with 600 kg ivory but was awarded a ridiculous sentence sending him right back to resume his illegal activities.

6 operations were carried to arrest the traffickers. The first and most crucial of the operations was carried out on August 8, when a Gabonese national of Cameroonian origin was arrested in Lambarene, Centre Gabon. He was driving a car with a partner inside. 19 elephant tusks and 4 pieces of ivory weighing a total of 120 kg were concealed in a hidden compartment of the vehicle. 18 rounds of 458 calibre ammunition, close to one million CFA francs in cash and an expired residence permit belonging to a well-known Cameroonian ivory trafficker were also uncovered in the car.

Vehicles fitted with secret compartments are used to conceal the ivory and evade controls. More than a dozen people could be involved, with ivory drop-off points spread across various provinces of Gabon. The charity said â€œorganised mafia-type networksâ€ are prepared to do anything to enrich themselves. Ofir Drori, founder of the EAGLE network, which is active in a dozen countries including Cameroon and Gabon said: â€œThe illegal wildlife trade is routed in corruption. This is a good example for that of a very criminal network driving elephants to extinction. ""It has already been caught once and rewarded with a ridiculous sentence only to continue their illegal activities undisturbed. One of the main leaders of the network was sentenced in Cameroon to a ridiculously low prison term despite being arrested with more than 600kg of ivory in 2020. And their illegal activities have continued undisturbed.â€

The operation involved the Gabonese judicial police and government directorates of forestry and wildlife, with the support of the NGO Conservation Justice. In early August, police in the province of Moyen-OgoouÃ© arrested a Gabonese man of Cameroonian origin, along with his wife. A search of their vehicle revealed a cache of 19 tusks and four pieces of ivory, weighing a total of 120kg. For context, 19 tusks mean at least nine elephants had been killed. The search also led to the confiscation of several rifle cartridges used for shooting big game, nearly 1 million CFA francs (about 1,500 euros) in cash, illicit substances and an expired residence permit belonging to a well-known Cameroonian ivory trafficker, according to Stephan Ekore Eko, an anti-poaching specialist at Gabon's Ministry of Water and Forests. Using fresh information from the suspect, the investigators were able to track down more traffickers. A total of ten people were arrested in separate locations, and nine of them were charged with involvement in â€œinternational ivory traffickingâ€, according to Jean Donald Ulrich Mbadinga, a legal expert with Conservation Justice. He said it took ten days for the operation to unravel the â€œvast network of international ivory traffickers in Gabonâ€. â€œThe ivory is taken from Gabon, is trafficked across the border to Cameroon, and from Cameroon to Nigeria and from Nigeria to the Asian market,â€ he said in a video sent to RFI. He explained that the network functioned like a pyramid: â€œAt the top, there is a leader who resides in Cameroon, and this leader works with collaborators who can be divided into two categories: the poachersâ€™ canvassers and the transporters.â€ Canvassers comb the whole of Gabon in search of villagers who can kill elephants, Mbadinga explained. Then when the ivory is available, transporters to go with the canvassers to collect it. The ivory is then transported to Cameroon, he said. â€œThis type of operation is vital and should be repeated to dismantle the few large ivory trafficking networks that have managed to survive in Gabon, where the political will to protect the environment remains strong,â€ says Luc Mathot, founding director of  Conservation Justice.

9 traffickers arrested with 21 elephant tusks weighing 131 kg in a crackdown on a major ivory trafficking ring using hidden compartments in vehicles. The seizure of 21 tusks and 4 ivory pieces is a mere snapshot of the regular activities of this vast network operating for many years with representatives and stations spread all over Gabon, Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon, trafficking ivory between Central and West Africa. This network, that is estimated to have generated the killings of thousands of elephants, demonstrates that corruption is the main enabler of organized wildlife trafficking. One of its heads has been arrested in Cameroon 3 years ago with 600 kg ivory but was awarded a ridiculous sentence sending him right back to resume his illegal activities. 6 operations were carried to arrest the traffickers. The first and most crucial of the operations was carried out on August 8, when a Gabonese national of Cameroonian origin was arrested in Lambarene, Centre Gabon. He was driving a car with a partner inside. 19 elephant tusks and 4 pieces of ivory weighing a total of 120 kg were concealed in a hidden compartment of the vehicle. 18 rounds of 458 calibre ammunition, close to one million CFA francs in cash and an expired residence permit belonging to a well-known Cameroonian ivory trafficker were also uncovered in the car.

A police officer attached to Central Police Station in Nakuru is among four suspects arrested over alleged involvement in a crime. Police in Molo nabbed the police officer and another suspect after they were found in possession of 10 kilograms of ivory, a gun, and 30 rounds of ammunition. The ivory was suspected to be stolen from the Nakuru County Commissioner's office. Molo Sub-County Police Commander Timon Odingo says they are conducting investigations to ascertain how and why the police officer left the Central Police Station with a gun. ""We arrived at Posta area where members of the public informed us that they had seen suspicious individuals , wananchi wakatuambia wameona watu suspicious wako na bag mbili na wako kwa pikipiki of registration number KMFE 674Z. The two men had a black bag,"" he said. ""Officers discovered that they had carried 5 ivories."" Two other suspects were arrested over a robbery incident in Molo Town.

The elephant tusks and a rifle recovered from the suspects in Molo on August 21, 2024.
Security officers in Molo have arrested two male adults and recovered five pieces of elephant tusks and a rifle. The two suspects aged 28 and 32 years were nabbed at the Posta area near the National Bank in Molo town by officers who were on a normal routine. Police said they received an intelligence report from the residents about the suspicious characters forcing them to rush to the scene. Upon arrival at the area, the officers led by Molo police station OCS confronted the duos who were riding on a motorcycle registration number KMFE 674Z. They were in possession of two black bags, police said. Upon conducting a search in the bags, the officers found a CZ EVO 3 Scorpion Rifle loaded with 30 rounds and five pieces of elephant ivory tusks. The tusks weighed approximately 10 kilograms with its street value yet to be ascertained. Preliminary investigations, police say, reveal that the suspects were from Nakuru and were in the process of delivering them to a buyer in Molo. They are now in police custody pending a further probe into the matter before being arraigned in court. â€œThe exhibits are kept awaiting further police action,â€ a police report states. Detectives handling the matter will be seeking to establish how the suspects obtained the weapon and if they are part of the gang engaged in criminal activities in the area and other towns. They will also be pursuing various leads to understand where the wildlife trophy were sourced from and its destination. â€œWe shall also be questioning them to help us nab the buyer of the tusks,â€ said an officer aware of the matter. Handling wildlife trophies is a serious offence which attracts heavy penalties and lengthy jail terms thanks to the overhauled Kenya Wildlife Conservation Act of 2013, which stipulates a maximum fine of Sh20 million or life imprisonment for convicts.

A 28-year-old police officer attached to Nakuru Central Police Station has been arrested by his colleagues while allegedly in the process of selling game trophies in Molo. Ben Muiru Mwangi was arrested alongside Maina Gichura, 32 in possession of ten kilograms of ivory outside one of the banks where the transaction was to take place. Speaking to the press, Molo Sub County Police Commander Timon Odingo said that they received information that the officer was transporting the ivory and set a trap for them. â€œThe suspects arrived at the scene riding on a motorcycle. Asked to identify themselves, the two declined while one attempted to open one of the loaded bags,â€ said Odingo. The police swung into action arresting the two and recovered the ivory and a firearm inside the bags. â€œWe recovered five pieces of ivory inside one of the bags. In the other bag, we found a CZ Scorpion gun which was loaded with 30 rounds of ammunition,â€ said Odingo. The SCPC said that their analysis of the firearm with serial number KPB431030 indicated that it belonged to the government. â€œThe firearm clearly belongs to the Kenya Police Service and we are yet to establish how it was issued out.

Two suspects have been arrested for an illegal trade of two tiger cubs and almost 100 kilogrammes of elephant tusks were also confisticated in a sting operation in Surin. National Park Office director Chaiwat Limlikhitaksorn on Tuesday led Phraya Sue special force, Natural Resources and Environmental Crime Suppression Division and local police to launch the sting operation to buy the tiger cubs for 350,000 baht in Sangkha district. In the operation, authorities seized the two tiger cubs â€“ one male and the other female â€“ that were put in the same cage. Evidence including chat history showed these cubs were bought from a tiger farm in Chon Buri for 200,000 baht. The cubs were found to be dehydrated and suffering from diarrhoea. â€œWe believe that the two cubs are from a tiger farm in Sri Racha district (in Chon Buri). We have strong evidence from chat messages. The farmâ€™s main market is in Cambodia,â€ he said. The two suspects were also found to have smuggled four Asian elephant tusks totalling 48kg, 26 pieces of African elephant ivories weighing 49.8kg in totaland, and 19 ivory products. The assets are value about 3 million baht in total. He said the authorities have tracked down the network for almost two years. A ten-day surveillance operation suggested the network was backed by local and national politicians. Currently, authorities are seeking search warrants to inspect locations suspected of being involved in the tiger trafficking and tracing down the networkâ€™s related individuals. The two suspects faced protected animals-related charges including possessing and trading protected animal carcasses, as well as elephant tusks without permission. The tiger cubs were later taken to Chulabhorn Wildlife Captive Breeding Centre in Si Sa Ket. Meanwhile, Athapol Charoenshunsa, director-general of the Department of Natural Resources, Wildlife and Plant Conservation (DNP), has instructed all relevant agencies to inspect every tiger farm and strict control measures on the increase of the tiger population will be put in place. In case of illegal trafficking of tigers, the tiger farm owners will have their license revoked or suspended and will face legal procedures, particularly the illegal activities in the tiger farm in Si Racha district of Chon Buri where there had been reports of sales of six tiger cubs.

Police arrested a Thai couple involved in the illegal wildlife trade, confiscating two tiger cubs, two pairs of Thai elephant tusks, and 26 pieces of African elephant tusks worth millions of baht. Efforts are underway to rescue an additional four tiger cubs. The operation, led by Director of the National Parks Office Chaiwat Limlikhitaksorn and officers from Dom Police Station in Surin province, was carried out yesterday. Officers, led by Police Colonel Yuthana Jaturat, successfully planned and executed a sting operation to apprehend the couple. The suspects, identified as 49 year old Karit and 48 year old Manat, were caught with the contraband at a roundabout in Ban Lantae, Theparak subdistrict. Police had been tracking the illegal wildlife trade network for some time, which was known for its long-standing reputation in the area. The plan involved negotiating the purchase of eight tiger cubs after the suspects posted about selling tiger cubs and ivory in a private Line group. To gain the suspectsâ€™ trust, the officials arranged for the illegal goods to be transported from Mukdahan province to the rendezvous point. However, it is believed that the main suspect became suspicious and instructed the couple to deliver only two tiger cubs and a portion of the ivory instead. Police inspected the designated location and found a grey Mercedes-Benz sedan with registration number à¸à¸ 7245 Bangkok. Inside the car, they discovered a pair of tiger cubs, approximately two to three months old, confined in a cage in the back seat. They also found two pairs of large Thai elephant tusks, each weighing 50 kilogrammes, valued at 20,000 baht per kilogramme, totalling over 2 million baht. Additionally, 26 pieces of African elephant tusks, weighing 49.8 kilogrammes and worth millions of baht, were found packed in fertilizer bags in the carâ€™s boot. The couple was immediately detained and brought in for questioning by the Dom Police Station about the origin of the seized items. During the interrogation, the suspects claimed that the tiger cubs were not theirs and had been left in their care along with the African elephant tusks. They asserted that they had documentation for the Thai elephant tusks but did not provide it to the police and refused to offer any useful information. The investigation is ongoing to identify and apprehend the main suspect behind this operation. Initially, the couple was handed over to Police Lieutenant Samart Klongdee at Dom Police Station to face charges for possessing and trading wildlife without permission, violating the Wildlife Preservation and Protection Act 2019. â€œWe have been monitoring this network for a long time. It is a very large network, and this seizure is just the beginning. It is crucial not only to apprehend the suspects but also to ensure the survival of the tigers. This is only a small part of what the suspects are involved in. I must thank our dedicated and self-sacrificing team.â€ Efforts are being made to locate and rescue the remaining four tiger cubs. The two seized cubs will undergo health checks and be cared for according to standard procedures. Regarding the Thai elephant tusks, the suspects claimed to have evidence of their acquisition but this was not provided. The tusks had stickers attached, which would need to be verified to determine their legitimacy, reported KhaoSod.

They asserted that they had documentation for the Thai elephant tusks but did not provide it to the police and refused to offer any useful information. The investigation is ongoing to identify and apprehend the main suspect behind this operation. Initially, the couple was handed over to Police Lieutenant Samart Klongdee at Dom Police Station to face charges for possessing and trading wildlife without permission, violating the Wildlife Preservation and Protection Act 2019. â€œWe have been monitoring this network for a long time. It is a very large network, and this seizure is just the beginning. It is crucial not only to apprehend the suspects but also to ensure the survival of the tigers. This is only a small part of what the suspects are involved in. I must thank our dedicated and self-sacrificing team.â€ Efforts are being made to locate and rescue the remaining four tiger cubs. The two seized cubs will undergo health checks and be cared for according to standard procedures. Regarding the Thai elephant tusks, the suspects claimed to have evidence of their acquisition but this was not provided. The tusks had stickers attached, which would need to be verified to determine their legitimacy, reported KhaoSod.

However, the prospective buyer managed to escape. ""We are on the lookout for the buyer,"" said V A Saravanan, Chennai DFO. Preliminary investigation revealed that the forest team seized a human-face ivory carving, a small bust with distinct facial features and hair and a pair of ivory tusks with elaborate carvings of human figurines.

The Delhi Police has arrested two people from Dhaula Kuan with two elephant tusks â€” the trade of which is banned under national and international law â€” weighing 1.8kg, officers aware of the case said on Monday. Deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Rohit Meena identified the arrested accused as Savita Devi, 42, a resident of Bahadurgarh, and Mohit Sharma, 24, a resident of Sangam Vihar. Officers said the police received information about a gang dealing in ivory from elephant tusks, and were looking for suspects for the past six months. Earlier this month, officers said, they received information that two people who were carrying elephant ivory were coming to Dhaula Kuan. â€œThe two were apprehended on Friday and two elephant ivory were recovered from themâ€ said a senior police officer. A team of the forest and wildlife department was then called to inspect the seized tusks, and based on their complaint, a first information report under various sections of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 was registered at the Delhi Cantonment police station on Friday. Deputy range officer (west) from Wild Life Department Tandon, who was part of the team, said trading of wildlife trophies, including tusks, animal skulls and other body parts, is strictly prohibited under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. â€œThe two ivory elephants tusks weighed around 1.8 kgs in total and since elephants are schedule 1 species and protected under the Wildlife Protection Act, we asked the police to lodge an FIR under the act,â€ he said. The police officer quoted above said the two were produced before court, and their custody was sought to â€œinvestigate the chain of source and receiver of the ivoryâ€.

The operation began on Tuesday night when officials, disguised as buyers, reached Nauru Saiâ€™s house in Bidyadharpur village, where the tusks were stored. The poachers insisted on conducting a religious ritual before the sale. They worshipped the tusks with an image of Hanuman, bananas, vermilion, oil and flowers. After the ceremony, they handed over the tusks to the undercover officials. At this point, other forest personnel arrived and arrested the seven suspects, seizing the tusks. A case has been registered under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.

Palembang, 27 August 2024. Gakkum LHK together with the South Sumatra Regional Police succeeded in arresting ZA (60), the perpetrator of the illegal trade in 8 (eight) Rhino Horns and Elephant Ivory Pipes in Palembang City, South Sumatra Province on Friday, 23 August 2024. The suspect ZA ( 60) was secured by officers when they were about to carry out a sale and purchase transaction of Rhino Horn and Elephant Ivory Pipes on Jalan Rama VII RT.03 RW.01 Alang-alanglebar, Palembang City â€“ South Sumatra.

From suspect ZA (60), 8 (eight) Rhino Horns and 5 (five) Elephant Tusk Pipes and 3 (three) Dugong Pipes were seized. ZA (60) is a resident who lives in Dua-Puluh-Empat Ilir Village, Bukit Kecil District, Palembang City, who acts as the owner and will sell the protected animals. Of the 8 (eight) rhino horns, it was identified that 4 rhino horns came from Indonesia and the other 4 came from abroad.

Ratio Ridho Sani, Director General of Law Enforcement at the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, said that the arrest of perpetrator ZA (60) should be a lesson for perpetrators of poaching and trafficking in protected animals, especially rhino horn. We will not stop fighting crimes against protected animals. Indonesia's exotic-flagship animals, such as the Javan Rhinoceros, Sumatran Rhino, Orang Utan, Sumatran Tiger, Sumatran Elephant, and Komodo are the wealth of the Indonesian nation, we must protect them.

Police working with agents from the Ministry of Environment and Forestry announced on Aug. 27 the arrest of a 60-year-old man in Palembang, South Sumatra province, for allegedly attempting to sell eight rhino horns, five tobacco pipes made of elephant ivory, and three pipes made from dugong tusks. The arrest took place on Aug. 23 during a string operation as the suspect, identified only by the initials Z.A., attempted to sell the products.

Authorities said they identified four of the rhino horns as belonging to Indonesian species, and the other four from abroad, but didnâ€™t specify which ones. Indonesia is home to two critically endangered rhino species, the Sumatran (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis) and Javan (Rhinoceros sondaicus), each with a total estimated population of less than 100.

â€œThis is a transnational crime,â€ Rasio Ridho Sani, the environment ministryâ€™s director-general of law enforcement, told reporters. â€œWe continue to strengthen the partnership with international law enforcement agencies, such as the Interpol and UNODC [United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime].â€

Indonesian authorities arrested a man trying to sell elephant tusks and the horns of critically endangered rhinos via social media. The illegal wildlife trade remains rampant in Indonesia, where law enforcement is lax, but the arrested man could face up to 15 years in prison if convicted, the environmental ministry said in a statement late Wednesday. South Sumatra police began an investigation after seeing posts on Facebook earlier this year offering parts of protected wildlife for sale. A 60-year-old man, identified only by the initials ""ZA"", was arrested last week during a transaction while trying to sell a rhino horn and a pipe made of an elephant tusk in Palembang, South Sumatra. Police found seven more rhino horns and at least four elephant tusks at his house. ""It seems like he's very experienced in wildlife trading,"" the environmental ministry said.

Two men from Mabvuku suburb in Harare, who were found in possession of raw ivory weighing about 20kg with an estimated value of US$3 281, have been arraigned before the courts. Bernard Chiumbe (50) and Vincent Chiumbe (25) appeared before Harare magistrate Ms Caroline Matanga yesterday charged with unlwaful possession of raw ivory. They were advised to apply for bail at the High Court and to return to court on July 8. Prosecuting, Mr Rufaro Chonzi alleged that on June 17 at around 3:52pm, detectives received information that the accused persons were in possession of ivory in Mabvuku and were looking for buyers. Acting on the information, one of the police officers managed to get Bernard's contact numbers and phoned him posing as a potential buyer. He agreed to meet the purported buyer at Old Tafara Shopping Centre. The court heard the detectives teamed up with other officers and proceeded to the meeting place in two vehicles. Upon arrival, the detective who pretended to be a buyer went to the vehicle where he spoke to Bernard and they agreed to complete the transaction at Sunbird Tarven Bar, which is a distance away from the shops. Bernard went to Sunbird Tarven Bar on foot and agreed to meet with the buyer after 15 minutes when the truck carrying the ivory would be at the same place. The detective was shown the ivory which was placed at the front passenger's seat and Vincent opened the white sack to reveal two elephant tusks. The detective coded others who came to arrest the duo. However, after noticing that the purported buyers are police officers, Bernard sped off with the ivory in the truck and the detectives gave chase. He was subdued at Chemhanza Ground which is about 800 metres away from the Sunbird Tarven Bar and detectives returned to arrest Vincent, who was still around the Bar area. The accused persons were asked to produce documentation authorising them to possess the ivory, but they failed, leading to their arrest. The Parks and Wildlife officials assayed and examined the recovered ivory which weighed 19,30 kilogrammes and was valued at US$3 281.

The Forest Department and Anti-Naxal Squad, in a joint operation, arrested a man in Pasakkuttai village, Thingalur panchayat, Talavadi block, and recovered a pair of elephant tusks on Wednesday. Acting on a tip-off that two tusks were being offered for sale, Forest Department staff, posing as prospective buyers, contacted the accused, P. Duraisamy, who asked them to visit his village at 1 a.m. to finalise the price. At his house, Duraisamy showed them the tusks, which he had concealed at the rear of his property, at which point he was apprehended. The staff recovered the tusks and took him to the division office.

Aditya Vikram (24), Karan Singh (40), and Natha Singh (45) were arrested in Uttar Pradesh's Bareilly with two elephant tusks about 3.2 feet long, valued at around Rs 1 crore in the illegal market. Aditya and Karan are from Bareilly, while Natha is from Nanakmatta in Udham Singh Nagar. Navneet Bhullar, SSP of Uttarakhand STF, said, ""We are committed to taking strict action against all involved in wildlife smuggling. Our team has been working to dismantle this network operating along the Uttarakhand-UP border."" The STF had received information that the three accused had been active in wildlife trafficking for some time. On Tuesday, circle officer (CO) of Uttarakhand STF with officials from UP STF and WCCB Delhi conducted a raid in Bareilly's CV Ganj area and the accused were caught with two tusks weighing around 7kg. They had initially sought to sell the ivory for Rs 70 lakh, with an aim to raise the price to Rs 1 crore. Aditya claimed the ivory was passed down from his maternal grandfather. However, investigators suspect the elephants may have been killed recently. Elephants are listed under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, making their hunting a serious offence. The tusks are believed to have come from a recently killed elephant, a crime that carries severe penalties. A case has been filed under the Wildlife Protection Act, and further investigation is ongoing.

According to police, the smugglers were roaming from one district to another to sell the ivory, which they wanted to sell for Rs 1 crore. On getting a tip-off, the STF posed as a buyer and struck a deal and the alleged smugglers got trapped, leading to the recovery of two 3.25-feet-long ivories, police said. The poachers had found buyers for up to Rs 70 lakh for the ivory weighing seven kilos, but they allegedly wanted to sell it for at least Rs 1 crore, police said, adding they kept looking for prospective buyers. According to police, the ivories were brought by accused Aditya Vikram, but the deal was being finalised by Natha Singh. Aditya first made an ""excuse"" that the ivory was ancestral and belonged to his maternal grandfather, who gave it to him, police added. Police said they believed the accused killed an elephant and extracted the ivories, adding that an investigation is ongoing into the matter. According to officials, a whole ivory is sold for up to Rs 1 crore in the black market and its price can go up to Rs 2 crore.

The special operations group (SOG) seized two elephant tusks from the Yakutpura area of the city on Wednesday and arrested two men. The tusks, each four-feet-long, are valued in lakhs of rupees in the black market. ""We had received a tip-off following which we raided the accused's house in Yakutpura and seized the ivory,"" said Vivek Patel, SOG police inspector. The accused were identified as Irfan Sheikh and Azaar Pathan. The police said that a man from Bihar gave them the tusks some time ago for selling them off. The accused were promised a 20% commission on the deal. ""We are now trying to track down the man who gave them these tusks. The tusks have been sent to the Wildlife Institute of India for DNA tests to ascertain what elephant species they belonged to. The tusks may be of an elephant from India or brought here from abroad,"" Patel told TOI. The accused don't have any criminal record, but the cops are investigating their network and why they were asked to sell the tusks. The forest department too has been involved in the investigations.

The suspected ivory traffickers were in possession of six ivory points cut into twelve pieces, which they were preparing to sell. Concealed in boxes, the six ivory points weigh 25.7 kg. At the time of the arrest, B.S.B, the first alleged ivory trafficker to be arrested, admitted to having bought two ivory points, which he was trying to sell illegally. K.R and M.F for their part mentioned having each found two ivory points in the forest without having informed the Water and Forests administration. Like B.S.B, the two men tried to illegally sell their famous finds. Whether B.S.B, K.R and M.F, the three traffickers each illegally possessed ivory points and were trying to sell them illegally. Within the meaning of the Penal Code in these articles 390 and 398, these facts constitute offenses of possession and attempted sale of ivory without prior authorization from the competent administrations. These acts are punishable by a prison sentence of up to ten years in prison. According to article 200 of the Forest Code, refraining from informing the Water and Forestry services of the discovery or finding of ivory constitutes an offense of violation of the provisions relating to ivory points found in particular for K.R and M.F.

The Nigeria Customs Service on Friday said it had arrested three men for alleged illegal export of elephant tusks to Asia. The men were arrested at different locations in Lagos between January 25, 2024, and February 4 and 6, 2024, for allegedly facilitating the sale and export of five pieces of elephant tusk, weighing 25.35kg, and worth about $16,000 equivalent (N23,520,000). It was gathered that the arrest involved the Customs Special Wildlife Office, and the Customs Police Unit during an intelligence-led, joint enforcement operation with the Wildlife Justice Commission. Nigeria is in a push to protect its dwindling elephant population from rampant wildlife traffickers, and Illegal wildlife export contravenes the Endangered Species Act and the Nigeria Customs Service Act. Over the past three decades, the countryâ€™s elephant population has declined drastically from an estimated 1,500 to less than 400 due to poaching for ivory, habitat loss, and human-elephant conflict, according to conservationists. The officer in charge of Nigeria Customs Service Special Wildlife Office, Assistant Comptroller Abim Isafiade said the Service is leaving no stone unturned in its commitment to end Illegal wildlife trade. He said that on January 9, 2024, Nigeria destroyed 2.5 tonnes of seized elephant tusks valued at over N9.9bn ($11.2 million). â€œThe Service is determined to dismantle the wildlife criminal networks operating within the country. â€œIllegal wildlife trade or trafficking of wildlife is a criminal offence punishable under law, and so Nigeria Customs Service will continue to support global efforts to fight Wildlife crime. â€œThe suspects will be charged to court as soon as investigations are concluded,â€ Isafiade said. Experts say tens of thousands of elephants are killed worldwide each year for their tusks.
That is despite a decades-long ban on the international trade of ivory. According to conservationists, Nigeria has become a hub for the illegal trade in animal parts from Africa. The biggest markets are said to be in Asia.

The court heard that Tasiiwa had just met Khumalo at the mall to buy shoes, and she had asked him to carry a bag for her. While they were still at the mall, police officers confronted them and searched the blue bag, in which they found a 12.5 kg sack of maize meal containing one whitish object wrapped in three different cloths. Khumalo told the police that it was her tusk, claiming she had found it in Plumtree and had asked her nephew to assist her in carrying it. The tusk was taken to the Bureau of Standards, where it was found to weigh 5.3 kg. Khumalo pleaded for leniency, stating that she is a first-time offender. â€œI am asking for forgiveness; this is my first time clashing with the law, and I will never do it again,â€ she pleaded. Her request for leniency was dismissed, and she was fined P20,000 and sentenced to four years in prison.

On Wednesday, 23rd October, the joint team of Bihar police and forest department arrested Trinamool Congress leader Ashok Kumar Ojha from West Bengal and 4 others for smuggling elephant tusks in Buxar district of Bihar. The officers raided a house in Devkuli village, located under the Brahmpur police station area in Bihar, and recovered two elephant tusks weighing around 23 kg, worth lakhs of rupees. The operation was executed as the police followed a tip-off of the illegal sale of tusks in the illegal market. As per the reports, the house that was raided by the police in Devkuli, from where the recovery of tusks was made, belonged to Burrabazar TMC leader Ojha. He has been the vice president of the North Kolkata Trinamool Hindi Cell and has been closely associated with the Jorasanko TMC MLA Vivek Gupta. After the arrest, the leader was notably expelled from the party. The five arrested persons including Ojha are being questioned. After the reports of his arrest, TMC reportedly expelled him from the party. However, as per MLA Vivek Gupta, this is not a case of smuggling. He claimed that Ashok Ojha used to keep elephants at his Bihar house, and one of his elephants died recently. The tusks belonged to the dead elephant, Gupta claimed. He added that the party has nothing to do with the incident and Ojha has been expelled from the party. BJPâ€™s Suvendu Adhikari took cognizance of the event and commented on X criticizing TMC for allegedly being a â€˜general store of crimesâ€™. He indicated that the party leaders had been involved in all types of scams and were now not even sparing the wildlife. â€œTMC is the general store of Crimes:- Coal Smuggling, Cow Smuggling, Illegal Sand & Stone Mining, MGNREGA Job Card Scam, Mid Day Meal Scam, Ration â€“ Food grains Smuggling, Teacher Recruitment Scam, Medical Equipment/Medicines Smuggling, Admission Scam.. The list growsâ€¦ Now Wildlife is also not being spared. I wonder whatâ€™s next !!!â€ he said. Notably, the other four accused persons arrested by the joint team along with Ojha have been identified as Ganpat Sah from Begusarai, Manoj Kumar Pandey from Pipra Jagdishpur, Paras Nath Ram from Karakat, and Dhananjay Prasad Singh from Tirasi Bigha, Rohtas. According to the police investigation, the smuggling network intended to sell the tusks after an elephant died in Devkuli during the COVID-19 outbreak. Police said that after the elephant died during the pandemic, an attempt was devised to sell its tusks illegally. According to forest department officials, transporting elephant tusks is a serious violation of the Wildlife Protection Act. Legal action will be taken against the accused to the full extent of the law. Further investigation is underway to discover more of those involved in the smuggling network.

They sold that dead elephant. He left two ivory tusks at home. The party has nothing to do with this incident. He has been expelled from the party and all posts.â€ On Wednesday, Adhikari shared on X, â€œProminent TMC leader Ashok Kumar Ojha of Burrabazar, Kolkata arrested from Biharâ€™s Buxar in Ivory smuggling case.

In a shocking turn of events, an Assistant Inspector of Police from the Armed Police Force of Trichy has been arrested for his involvement in the sale of toys made from elephant tusks. The arrest was made by Villupuram forest department officials, who received information about a gang smuggling elephant tusk toys into Villupuram town. Four elephant ivory toys weighing 6Â½ kg and a necklace, along with a car and three two-wheelers used for smuggling, were seized from the arrested individuals. These toys are estimated to be around 50 years old and are valued at several lakhs. On the 13th of last month, forest officials received a tip-off about the smuggling and quickly swung into action, arresting 12 people, including Viswanathanâ€™s wife Eeswari (50), Karuppusamy (24), Mohammad Ziauddin (50) from Papanasam Devarajanpettai in Thanjavur district, Justice (46) from Aranthangi L.R.

Further investigation revealed that Police Sub-Inspector Manivannan (50) was involved in the sale of elephant tusks. He had obtained the elephant tusks from one of his relatives and sold them illegally through Eswari and Ziauddin. This information was revealed by Eswari, Ziauddin during questioning. The Villupuram Forest Department officials informed the Trichy District Police high-ranking officials about Manivannanâ€™s involvement, leading to his departmental suspension. Manivannan was later summoned to the Villupuram Forest Department office for questioning. Forest Department officials led by Forest Department Officer Kamalakannan conducted an intensive investigation, confirming Manivannanâ€™s involvement in the sale of elephant tusk toys. He was subsequently arrested and produced before the Villupuram Magistrateâ€™s Court, where he was sent to jail. The arrest of a police sub-inspector from Trichy in the sale of toys made of elephant tusks has created a stir. The forest department has decided to investigate how Manivannanâ€™s relative acquired the elephant toys and plans to make further arrests. This case has sparked widespread attention and speculation about potential involvement of other government officials or political figures. The list of people involved in the smuggling and sale of elephant toys is likely to grow, with forest department officials expecting to uncover more details as the investigation unfolds.

Four individuals, aged between 50 and 66, have been arrested in Wangdue for allegedly attempting to strike a deal involving four Asian elephant tusks in Punatshangchhu. The suspects were apprehended on November 11 and are currently held at the Wangdue police station for investigations. Sources revealed that one of the suspects purchased the tusks from an  Indian national in Gelephu, and later transported them to Wangdue at the request of another individual involved in the deal. Police are investigating the authenticity of the tusks, but it has not been confirmed whether they are genuine elephant tusks. Further details are being withheld by the Wangdue police, who stated that the case is still under investigation. The Asian elephant, classified as endangered, is protected under Schedule I of the Forest and Nature Conservation Rules of 2023, which includes other at-risk species such as the snow leopard, tiger, and musk deer. These species are granted the highest level of protection under Bhutanâ€™s Forest and Nature Conservation Act of 2023. According to the Act, killing an animal listed under Schedule I is considered a third-degree felony, punishable by a prison sentence of five to nine years. In addition to imprisonment, those found guilty are required to pay compensation of Nu. 100,000 per tusk. For a pair of tusks, this would total Nu. 200,000. The severity of the offense depends on the level of involvement in the crime. If suspects are found guilty of capturing an elephant, it is classified as a fourth-degree felony. However, if the elephant is killed, the crime is elevated to a third-degree felony. Individuals involved in trafficking wildlife products, such as elephant tusks, would be charged under a fourth-degree felony. Once the court delivers its verdict, the seized tusks will be transferred to the Department of Forests. They will then be handed over to the Taxidermy Unit for proper storage of the animal parts.

Two men from Mabvuku suburb in Harare, who were found in possession of raw ivory weighing about 20kg with an estimated value of US$3 281, have been arraigned before the courts. Bernard Chiumbe (50) and Vincent Chiumbe (25) appeared before Harare magistrate Ms Caroline Matanga yesterday charged with unlwaful possession of raw ivory. They were advised to apply for bail at the High Court and to return to court on July 8. Prosecuting, Mr Rufaro Chonzi alleged that on June 17 at around 3:52pm, detectives received information that the accused persons were in possession of ivory in Mabvuku and were looking for buyers. Acting on the information, one of the police officers managed to get Bernard's contact numbers and phoned him posing as a potential buyer. He agreed to meet the purported buyer at Old Tafara Shopping Centre. The court heard the detectives teamed up with other officers and proceeded to the meeting place in two vehicles. Upon arrival, the detective who pretended to be a buyer went to the vehicle where he spoke to Bernard and they agreed to complete the transaction at Sunbird Tarven Bar, which is a distance away from the shops. Bernard went to Sunbird Tarven Bar on foot and agreed to meet with the buyer after 15 minutes when the truck carrying the ivory would be at the same place. The detective was shown the ivory which was placed at the front passenger's seat and Vincent opened the white sack to reveal two elephant tusks. The detective coded others who came to arrest the duo. However, after noticing that the purported buyers are police officers, Bernard sped off with the ivory in the truck and the detectives gave chase. He was subdued at Chemhanza Ground which is about 800 metres away from the Sunbird Tarven Bar and detectives returned to arrest Vincent, who was still around the Bar area. The accused persons were asked to produce documentation authorising them to possess the ivory, but they failed, leading to their arrest.

South West Police Headquarters deputy public relations officer Beatrice Mikuwa says six people have been arrested in Blantyre for allegedly being found in possession of ivory and rhino horns.

Speaking yesterday at the regional police headquarters, she identified the suspects as Chrissy Dailes, 45, Helen Maunjeni, 55, Eliza Mpira, 45, Lonex Lopanda, 35, Omar Nadim, 55, and Steven Kandoje (age not advised).

Mikuwa said Lopanda and Mpira were arrested in Mpemba where they went to sell the horns which they reportedly stole from their boss, Nadim.


She said police intercepted the suspects while they were trying to sell the items.

Said Mikuwa: â€œMpira and Lopanda were working at Nadimâ€™s house. While there, they found some horns in the house and they connived to steal them.

â€œAfter being arrested and upon being questioned, they led the police to Nadimâ€™s house where we found the ivory. So far, all six suspects have been taken to court for a plea.â€

She has assured Malawians that the police will work on the case in collaboration with the Department of National Parks and Wildlife. 

In a separate interview, Department of National Parks and Wildlife director Brighton Kumchedwa said said cases of poaching animals have since 2019 dropped by 50 percent.

â€œIt is a good development in the sense that the police can arrest people committing wildlife crime.

â€œWhat you might wish to know is that illegal ivory trade has declined so much because of the strengthened enforcement of the law.â€

Five former employees of the Noi Bai International Airport were sentenced to a maximum of nine years in prison by the Hanoi Peopleâ€™s Court on Tuesday, for violating regulations on the protection of endangered, precious and rare animals.
The employees were found to have exploited their positions at the airport to illegally transport rhino horns and elephant tusks.

According to the indictment, on June 27, 2023, authorities discovered that Nguyá»…n ÄoÃ n GiÃ¡p, a shift leader in the baggage service team, had illicitly taken four suitcases.

His suspicious behaviour caught the attention of authorities, who requested GiÃ¡p to open the suitcases. Inside, they found 54kg of elephant tusks and over 22kg of rhino horns.

The investigation revealed that the defendants were hired by Nguyá»…n Há»“ng VÃ¢n, who is currently on the run, to transport the horns and tusks. The smuggled suitcases, marked in advance, would be transported from the baggage area to the domestic E hall, where they would be handed over to VÃ¢n's associates in exchange for payment.

Specifically, DÆ°Æ¡ng NgÃ´ Thu received VNÄ40 million (US$1,592) per item from Nguyá»…n Há»“ng VÃ¢n, while HÃ¹ng and GiÃ¡p received VNÄ20 million (US$796) per item. The defendants also confessed to repeatedly receiving items sent from abroad for Nguyá»…n Há»“ng VÃ¢n, with total payments reaching billions of Ä‘á»“ng.

Based on the evidence, the court sentenced Thu, a former employee of the Ná»™i BÃ i International Airport Security Centre, to nine years in prison for violating regulations on the protection of endangered, precious, and rare animals. Pháº¡m Huy HÃ¹ng and Nguyá»…n ÄoÃ n GiÃ¡p, both former employees of the Viá»‡t Nam Airport Ground Services Company, received eight-year sentences for the same offence.
