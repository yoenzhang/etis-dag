"the star four suspects were on saturday arrested while trying to sell ten pieces of elephant tusks weighing 28 kilograms in busia town. the four were riding on a bodaboda when they were intercepted by police and kenya wildlife service officials who had been tipped off. upon searching two gunny bags they were ferrying with ten pieces of elephant tusks weighing 28 kilogrames with an estimated street value of sh2.8 million were recovered, police said. the two men and two women said they were taking the same to a potential buyer when they were intercepted on july 29. the buyer happened to be an undercover detective who had been tipped off about the deal. police say they are yet to know the source of the tusks. the suspects were monday, july 31 expected in court as police investigate the source of the tusks. elephant tusks fetch a fortune in the black market as a surge in demand for ivory in the east continues to fuel the illicit trade in elephant tusks, especially from africa. officials say despite a ban on the international trade in ivory, african elephants are still being poached in large numbers. as part of efforts to stop the menace, kenya has started using high-tech surveillance equipment, including drones, to track poachers and keep tabs on elephants and rhinos. kws and stakeholders have put in place mechanisms to eradicate all forms of wildlife crime, particularly poaching. hese mechanisms include enhanced community education, interagency collaboration, and intensive intelligence-led operations, among others. these efforts led to zero rhino poaching in kenya in 2020-the first time in about two decades. at least 20,000 elephants are killed annually in africa for their ivory. this translates to 55 elephants killed daily or one elephant killed every 26 minutes with a population of 35,000 elephants. on april 30, 2016, kenya set ablaze 105 tonnes of elephant ivory and 1.35 tonnes of rhino horn. former president uhuru kenyatta led world leaders and conservationists in burning the remains of 6,500 elephants and 450 rhinos killed for their tusks and horn. parliament has also passed strict anti-poaching laws and the government has beefed up security at parks to stop poaching, which threatens the vital tourism industry. regionally, kenya has also emerged as a major transit route for ivory destined for asian markets from eastern and central africa. the illegal ivory trade is mostly fuelled by demand in asia and the middle east, where elephant tusks and rhino horns are used to make ornaments and traditional medicines. https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/realtime/2023-07-31-four-arrested-elephant-tusks-worth-sh28m-found-in-busia/",1

"chocolate industry braces as ivory coast expects dire cocoa crop - voa languages search previous next breaking news africa chocolate industry braces as ivory coast expects dire cocoa crop january 24, 2025 10:03 am by reuters file - cocoa pods are seen at a farm in daloa, ivory coast, on oct. 2, 2023. experts say the 2025 mid-crop cocoa harvest will be down about 40% from the yearly average. ivory coast expects to record one of the worst mid-crop cocoa harvests of the last 15 years this season with production seen no higher than 300,000 metric tons compared with a yearly average of 500,000 tons, regulator and industry sources said. a poor harvest could add upward pressure to cocoa prices, which are already around record highs after nearly tripling last year. analysts have said the chocolate industry is in for a rough 2025 that could see shelf prices increase by a percentage in the teens. ivory coast is the world's top cocoa producer, but a lack of rain and excessive heat since november across all its 13 growing regions have stalled development of the mid-crop harvest, which is meant to start in april. the unfavorable conditions mean that the first beans will start to arrive in ports in june at the earliest, provided the weather improves and rains return in the coming weeks, the sources said. ""there is no sign of any production at all on almost any plantation in the country,"" said a pod counter who had just visited ivory coast farms. his words echo those of two regulator officials, who said that after touring farms their team decided to lower the outlook for cocoa production to 300,000 metric tons from 400,000 tons. ""like everyone else, we're seeing the same thing. the mid-crop harvest will be one of the worst in 15 years,"" one of the officials said. he added that the regulator had sold only about 250,000 tons in export contracts to grinders, preferring to be cautious. the regulator sources said the entire mid-crop harvest would be sold to local grinders to guarantee them the volumes necessary to maintain their activity. a dozen planters and middlemen across the west african country described the situation as unprecedented, characterized by a total absence of flowers and small pods after those that appeared in december and january dried up in the high heat. ""even if the rain comes today ... it's already too late,"" said paul kouame kouakou, who owns four hectares of cocoa in duekoue, a town in west ivory coast. it usually takes a flower around 22 weeks to become a mature pod. while the harvest was expected to start in april, there will be no cocoa until at least june, the farmer said. ""usually, it's around november and december that we get the rains that herald the mid-crop harvest, but this year there's been no rain so far, and february and march are the hottest months,"" said another pod counter. he visited dozens of plantations that did not have any sign of flowers or pods, which he called ""very bad news"" for the crop.  us to expel south africa ambassador as relations deteriorate archaeologists use song to herald findings in guinea-bissau dig africa faces diabetes crisis, study finds botswana hunting revenues almost double amid uk opposition children being brutalized in sudan's civil war, say unicef and msf special report by the numbers: coups in africa the day in photos march 13, 2025 ​",0

"genitalia from girls mutilated in ivory coast sold for magic - global news - inquirer.net mory bamba, a muslim religious leader who fights against the excision of girls, holds a fetish used by former circumcisers in his village near touba on july 10, 2024. genitalia illegally cut from girls in “circumcision” ceremonies is used in several regions of the west african country to “make love potions” or magic ointments that some believe will help them “make money or reach high political office”, said labe gneble, head of the national organisation for women, children and the family (onef). agence france-presse touba, ivory coast — when he was a witch doctor, moussa diallo would regularly smear himself in a lotion made from a clitoris cut from a girl subjected to female genital mutilation. “i wanted to be a big chief, i wanted to dominate,” said the small but charismatic fiftysomething from northwest ivory coast. article continues after this  “i put it on my face and body” every three months or so “for about three years”, said diallo, who asked afp not to use his real name.  than a quarter of a century. despite that, one in five ivorian women are still being cut, according to the oecd, with one in two being mutilated in parts of the north. cut and mixed with plants before he had a crisis of conscience and decided to campaign against fgm, diallo said he was often asked by the women who performed excisions around the small town of touba to use his powers to protect them from evil spells. female circumcision has been practised by different religions in west africa for centuries, with most girls cut between childhood and adolescence. many families consider it a rite of passage or a way to control and repress female sexuality, according to un children’s agency unicef, which condemns cutting as a dangerous violation of girls’ fundamental rights. beyond the physical and psychological pain, cutting can be fatal, lead to sterility, birth complications, chronic infections and bleeding, not to mention the loss of sexual pleasure. diallo would often accompany the women who do the cutting out into the forest or to a home where dozens of girls would be circumcised, often surrounded by fetishes and sacred objects. so it was relatively easy for the former faith healer to obtain the precious powder. “when they would cut the clitorises they would dry them for a month or two then pound them with stones,” he said. the result was a “black powder” which was then sometimes mixed with “leaves, roots and bark” or shea butter that is often used in cosmetics. they could then sell it for around “100,000 cfa francs (152 euros) if the girl was a virgin” or “65,000 (99 euros) if she already had a child” or barter it for goods and services, diallo added. the ex-witch doctor said he was able to get some of the powder recently — a mix of human flesh and plants, he believes — from a cutter in his village. afp was shown the powder but was unable to analyze it without buying it. ‘organ trafficking’ former circumcisers interviewed by afp insisted that clitorises cut from girls are either buried, thrown into a river or given to the parents, depending on local custom. but one in the west of the country admitted some end up being used for magic. “some people pretend they are the girls’ parents and go off with the clitoris,” she said. witch doctors use them for “incantations” and sell them afterwards, she claimed. another circumciser said some of her colleagues were complicit in the trade, “giving (genitalia) to people who are up to no good” for occult purposes. mutilated when she was still a child, one victim told afp that her mother warned her to bring home the flesh that had been cut. the trade is regarded as “organ trafficking” in ivorian law and is punishable —",0

"bangalore mirror in a major operation, officials of the karnataka police department and tamil nadu forest departments came together to arrest an inter-state gang in connection with a recent ivory smuggling case. in what can only be described as a well-coordinated interdepartmental approach, both the accused were arrested by the officials for their involvement in transporting ivory across the state border on february 16. the officials from tamil nadu forest department tied up the loose end for hebbaguddi police officials by nabbing both the absconding men and handing them over to the officials for further interrogation. earlier, the hebbaguddi police officials had arrested six men while they were transporting a pair of tusks weighing 14 kilograms. officials say that all six arrested were only the middlemen. “the main accused were at large. we have now arrested two men – pavan raj and basavaraj,” informed karthikeyani k, wildlife warden, hosur forest division, tamil nadu forest department. karthikeyani said, “we were tipped off on their whereabouts through local intelligence. once we had their addresses, we arrested one of the accused from his home, whereas the second accused was nabbed later from the neighborhood,” said. “so far, the accused have maintained that the tusks were not obtained from a live animal. as per the information they are divulging, they found the tusks in a rocky area around their village in hosur. however, further interrogation is on,” said a police official. wildlife experts say that this is a clear case of poaching and there should be comprehensive inquiry into the issue. sharath babu, a wildlife enthusiast, said: “it is not a case of tusks collection after the animal has shed it naturally. the animal, in all probability, was shot and the tusks were harvested. tusks that are shed naturally look different.” he further stated, “one of the tusks is larger than the other. when an elephant is shot by an untrained hunter, the animal either falls on its left or its right. so, while the tusk facing the sky can be easily harvested, the one on the ground cannot be taken out completely because of the weight of the animal.” https://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/bangalore/crime/ivory-racket-smugglers-tracked-down/articleshowprint/89782033.cms?prtpage=1",1

"ivory coast man charged with participating in a sextortion scheme that caused the death ... press release ivory coast man charged with participating in a sextortion scheme that caused the death of a north dakota teenager wednesday, january 22, 2025 for immediate release u.s. attorney's office, district of north dakota bismarck – united states attorney mac schneider announced that a federal grand jury has returned an indictment charging aly cherif, a/k/a australien choco, a/k/a australien ch’co, a/k/a michael jhonson, a/k/a ali aly, age 23, from the ivory coast, with 1) cyberstalking resulting in death; 2) wire fraud; 3) conspiracy to commit wire fraud; 4) extortion; and 5) distribution of child pornography, which resulted in the death of a north dakota teenager.the indictment unsealed today alleges that cherif, and other individuals located in the ivory coast, participated in a well-organized sextortion group that targeted victims throughout the world. “sextortion” is a term used to describe a scheme to defraud where individuals use the threat of releasing photographs or videos which depict people’s private, intimate, or sexual acts to fraudulently coerce those people to send money based upon falsehoods, blackmail, and threats, in exchange for the sextortioners’ promise to not release these photographs or videos. specifically, sextortioners perpetrating sextortion schemes utilize false claims to induce victims to send photographs or videos of themselves—or to engage in video chats where the sextortioners record victims—nude or engaged in private, intimate, or sexual acts, and then the sextortioners threaten to release these photographs or videos to friends, family, work colleagues, or threaten to post these photographs or videos on the internet, unless the victim pays money to the sextortioners.additionally, as alleged in the indictment, cherif and others in the sextortion group targeted a north dakota teenager by obtaining publicly available photographs of an attractive woman from the internet and then fraudulently used these photographs to create or modify a facebook account to falsely pose as a woman named “emily thompson.” thereafter, the sextortion group contacted the minor victim through facebook chat and falsely stated that they were “emily thompson,” and that “emily thompson” was twenty (20) years old and lived in montana, when in fact, cherif and the sextortion group were operating this facebook account, not a woman named “emily thompson.” next, the sextortion group obtained a video recording and photographs of the minor victim engaging in a private, intimate, or sexual act, and used extortion tactics to attempt to force the minor victim to pay money so that “emily thompson” would not release videos and photographs of the minor victim engaging in these acts. when the minor victim informed “emily thompson,” that the minor victim did not have any money, the sextortion group distributed images of the minor victim’s genitalia on facebook. shortly thereafter, the minor victim committed suicide.“the united states attorney’s office and our partners in law enforcement are committed to obtaining a measure of justice for this family,” schneider said. “the indictment alleges greed, deception, and child exploitation that led to a heartrending tragedy. as we pursue justice in this case, we want to deter similar conduct and remind kids and families that help is available if they become victims of sextortion.”""this case is a stark reminder of the dangers children face online, where predators use deception and technology to exploit the most vulnerable among us,"" said special agent in charge alvin m. winston sr."" the fbi and our partners will continue working tirelessly to protect children and bring those who seek to harm them to justice.""an indictment is an accusation and notice of charges. the defendant is presumed innocent under the law unless and until proven guilty.to report a sextortion scam, contact your local fbi field office at 1-800-call-fbi.to learn",0

the plaques decorated the oba’s palace walls while the heads were commemorative portraits. however, the category also includes items made of iron, ivory and wood.the artifacts, the artistic wealth of the kingdom, were looted in 1897 after a bloody trade dispute between britain and benin.founded in the 11th century, benin was a wealthy state controlling trade on the west coast of africa and the niger river. in the late 19th century, britain, which obtained palm oil and ivory from benin and was colonizing its neighbours, forced an exclusive trade treaty on the oba. complaining its ums, some donated by descendants of the officers who had looted them; others purchased on the art market.however, very few items found their way to canada.open this photo in gallery:a 16th or 17th century brass plaque, the oldest benin artifact in the collection of the montreal museum of fine arts.supplied“we are pretty far down the list,” said stéphane aquin, director at the montreal museum of fine arts, the largest canadian custodian with merely five benin items in its collection. the british museum in london holds the largest group of all with 944 items. montreal’s collection includes three bronze and brass pieces that typify benin artistry. one is a plaque, about 50 centimetres high, showing a benin courtier holding a ceremonial hammer and wearing a bowler hat of a kind adopted from portuguese traders. it dates to the 16th or 17th century, and is the oldest and most significant of montreal’s objects.the collection also includes an 18th-century brass staff topped by a bird and two other metal figures from the 19th century, a pendant mask and a commemorative head commissioned by one oba after his predecessor’s death. the collection also includes a ceremonial carved ivory tusk that would have been placed with a commemorative head on an altar. the plaque, the head and the tusk are all on display in the mmfa’s galleries dedicated to global art.the royal ontario museum in toronto also has a 19th-century tusk and a wooden commemorative head, and one of the brass plaques from the palace walls, forged by the brass-makers guild in benin and dating to the mid-16th century. its fourth artifact is a small bronze figure of a warrior that postdates the looting.open this photo in gallery:a late-19th century carved ivory tusk from the historic kingdom of benin, now in the collection of the royal ontario museum.royal ontario museumopen this photo in gallery:left: a brass relief plaque, dating to the mid 16th century, of the kind that covered the walls of the oba's palace in historic benin, now in nigeria's edo state. and right: a wooden commemorative head from historic benin, dating to the 19th century. both from the collection of the royal ontario museum.royal ontario museumnone of the rom’s objects are on display but they are listed in digital benin, a project run out of hamburg’s rothenbaum museum of world cultures with international and nigerian participation. launched in 2020, it aims to establish a complete digital catalogue of all the scattered benin art. currently, it lists 5,285 objects from 136 institutions in 20 countries. only 400 objects are located in nigeria.as well as listing their objects on digital benin, the rom and the mmfa participate in the benin dialogue group. european museums and nigerian institutions launched the group in 2010 with the goal of seeing the objects reassembled in a museum in benin city in edo state. the nigerian participation includes both its museums commission and the local edo government but also the royal court of benin. jesus college at cambridge became the first to restore an object, handing over a bronze cockerel to the museums commission in 2021 in a ceremony at which the oba’s brother was present.the situation seemed relatively straightforward – the art should be returned to nigeria via the museums commission – until 2023 when outgoing president muhammadu buhari published a decree stating the bronzes should be returned to ewuare.in july, the stanley museum of art at the university of iowa caused some consternation when it returned a brass plaque and wooden altarpiece directly to ewuare, the first u.s. institution to favour the royal claim. in an inter in 1960, but the canadian museum of history’s single object is an interesting one: a bronze bell with a human face using a casting technique that would date it to the 16th century and workshops outside of benin, in the area of the lower niger.it arrived at the canadian museum in 1970, but it’s a good example of the way these objects can be traced back to the looting. it was collected in 1897, probably by w.d. webster, a member of the punitive expedition, and then sold to augustus pitt rivers, the british general and collector for whom the museum at oxford university is named. today the pitt rivers holds 148 objects and says it is",0

"the absolute joy of attending a merchant ivory movie weekend at my local theater merchant ivory's howards end (4k restoration) | official us trailer | academy award winner | cohen media groupmerchant ivory productions represented the epitome of prestige art filmmaking and their films in the 1980s and ’90s and were a revelation to me. beginning with a room with a view, combined with my two other favorites, howard’s end and the remains of the day, these timeless masterpieces immersed me in an exquisite world of edwardian drama. helmed by the brilliant quartet of american james ivory as screenwriter and director, indian-born ismail merchant, novelist and screenwriter ruth prawer jhabvala, and composer richard robbins, i now realize how incredibly we were spoiled at that time by their historical masterpieces.what made the movies from merchant ivory production so intoxicating for me? i don’t think i’m the only one who couldn’t get enough of the kind of wondrous detail to history, brought to life with stunning cinematography (who could forget those walks among the bluebells in howard’s end?), sumptuous settings (that unforgettable quisisana e ponte vecchio square in a room with a view), emotional honesty, beautifully detailed costumes (all the lace that dame emma thompson dons in howard’s end), nuanced writing, swooning music (remains of the day’s haunting soundtrack) and of course those fascinatingly complex characters. you have all that brilliance along with some of the best actors that have ever lived to bring these intricate worlds to life. thompson not only starred alongside sir anthony hopkins in howard’s end, but they brought to the screen one of the most devastating relationships i’ve ever seen play in theaters, in the heartbreaking remains of the day. merchant ivory’s prestigious productions also included the late dame maggie smith, dame judi dench, helena bonham carter of course, hugh grant, vanessa redgrave, the late julian sands, simon callow, daniel day-lewis, rupert graves, christopher reeves, and even a young lena headey (way before game of thrones). it would have been impossible to cast these film gems any better.so when my local art house theater (the historic jane pickens) was putting on a mini-merchant ivory festival, i of course jumped at the chance. i’m sad to say that i missed the showing of a room with a view, the magnificent love letter to italy, because of a conflict. this was the film that broke ground for merchant ivory and for historic art films in general. when it arrived in 1985, it caused a sensation. a tale of an independent-minded edwardian woman (bonham carter) who is torn between her family-approved engagement to the priggish, intellectual cecil vyse (day-lewis) and her love for the free-spirited romantic george emerson (sands, in what would be his most captivating role), it’s the cinematic atmosphere that draws you in. the lush scenery of italy and the compellingly detailed characters proved intoxicating to audiences, with a room with a view breaking ground for art house cinema. i know people who have stayed in that very square in florence just because of that film. next on the agenda was howard’s end, which took cannes and oscars by storm when it came out in 1992. it was absolutely thrilling to see it once",0
"rats can sniff out horns and tusks to combat wildlife trafficking - earth.com 10-31-2024rats can sniff out horns and tusks to combat wildlife traffickingbyandrei ionescuearth.com staff writerin a remarkable development in the fight against wildlife trafficking, african giant pouched rats have been trained to detect pangolin scales, elephant ivory, rhino horn, and african blackwood. previously known for detecting explosives and tuberculosis, these rodents are proving to be versatile allies in conservation efforts. “our study shows that we can train african giant pouched rats to detect illegally trafficked wildlife, even when it has been concealed among other substances,” said lead author isabelle szott, a researcher at the okeanos foundation. “the rats also continued to detect the wildlife targets after not encountering that species for a long period,” added co-author kate webb, an assistant professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at duke university.the study was conducted at apopo, a non-profit organization based in tanzania that develops low-tech, cost-effective solutions to humanitarian challenges.rats in the fight against wildlife traffickingto prepare for the detection tasks, the rats – kirsty, marty, attenborough, irwin, betty, teddy, ivory, ebony, desmond, thoreau, and fossey (many named after renowned conservationists) – underwent a series of training stages. each rat learned to recognize specific wildlife scents through what researchers called “indication training,” where the rats held their noses over a scented target for a few seconds. a correct response was rewarded with flavored rodent pellets, motivating them to repeat the behavior.as their training progressed, the rats were introduced to various non-target scents such as electric cables, coffee beans, and washing powder – substances often used by traffickers to mask wildlife scents. “during the discrimination stage, rats learn to only signal the odors of the wildlife targets while ignoring non-targets,” szott explained.the study demonstrated the rats’ impressive retention abilities. after periods of five and eight months without exposure to the target scents, the rats could still recognize them with perfect retention scores, a level of cognitive retention comparable to that of trained dogs. by the end of the training program, eight rats successfully identified four wildlife species from 146 other substances commonly found in shipping cargo.rats are a practical solution “existing screening tools are expensive and time intensive, and there is an urgent need to increase cargo screening. apopo’s rats are cost-efficient scent detection tools,” said szott.“they can easily access tight spaces",0

"ghana's asante kingdom: celebrating the king banished by the british to seychelles - bbc the field outside the royal palace in the ghanaian city of kumasi was filled with an exuberant crowd, celebrating the return 100 years ago of an exiled king. prempeh was the asante king, or ""asantehene"", of the late 19th century who resisted british demands that his territory be swallowed up into the expanding gold coast protectorate. a british army from the coast marched about 200km (124 miles) to kumasi in 1896, and took prempeh as well as about 50 relatives, chiefs and servants as prisoners, and then looted his palace. the prisoners were taken to the coastal fort at elmina, before being shipped to sierra leone, and, in 1900, on to the distant indian ocean islands of seychelles. it was not until 1924 that the british allowed prempeh to return home, by which time he was an elderly man who arrived in kumasi wearing a european suit and hat. it is a tragic story, but also one of pride and resistance. ""the british did all they could but they couldn’t break the spirit of asante,"" shouted the master of ceremonies. the current asantehene, osei tutu ii, was paraded on his palanquin through the crowd, weighed down by magnificent gold jewellery, amid a glorious cacophony of musket explosions, drum beats and the blare of horns made from elephant tusks. asante culture is alive and well. but prempeh’s exile did have a lasting impact on both the asante kingdom and seychelles, although perhaps not in ways intended by british officials at the time. the guest of honour at the centenary celebrations, held in kumasi at the weekend, was seychelles' president wavel ramkalawan, who said ""it was an honour, though sad, for us to receive your great king"". ""he showed respect to our people, and in return received the full love of the seychelles,"" ramkalawan added. the proof of that is in family ties cherished to this day. princess mary prempeh marimba is prempeh’s great-grand-daughter. her grandfather, james, the son of prempeh, married a seychellois woman, and initially stayed on the islands after his father left. mary is a nursing supervisor in seychelles' capital, victoria, and travelled to kumasi with her daughter suzy, to re-unite with dozens of long-lost relatives and discover",0

zavagli, 2021). iwt is closely linked to crimes such as money laundering, corruption, and simultaneous trafficking of drugs, weapons, and/or humans (fatf, 2020; unodc, 2020; zavagli, 2021). additionally, the sp logistical flexibility and training cost is cheaper than purchasing and running x-ray scanners. nevertheless, canine units face additional limitations. each scent-detection dog requires up to one year of training and is associated with high purchasing and maintenance costs, with some training organizations estimating between $20,000–30,000 usd per dog (king, 2013). a conservation dog requires a skilled handler who further requires training and investment, and the dog may not be easily transferrable between handlers. the efficacy of canine units is also tempered because they cannot search containers loaded onto trucks without the provision of steps to access the seal or penetrate tightly packed areas within shipping parcels. containers stacked on top of each other further increase the distance between potential targets and the detection dog, leading to odors becoming increasingly diluted (lazarowski et al., 2020), further reducing the ability of canines to screen additional layers of cargo.like dogs, african giant pouched rats (cricetomys ansorgei, henceforth rats) have been successfully deployed for scent detection work (c.f., weetjens et al., 2009; poling et al., 2011a, b; ellis et al., 2017). these rats have extensive olfactory receptor repertoires and large olfactory bulbs (freeman et al., 2020) which speaks to their ability to detect and discriminate a large variety of odors. further, this species has an average life span between seven to nine years which makes them suitable to be trained and subsequently deployed as scent detection animals (webb et al., 2020). the rats are adapted to the sub-saharan climate, occurring across east and southern africa (olayemi et al., 2012), and can be trained to search for multiple odor targets (webb et al., 2020). their small size makes them",0

"chirume carvings implore elephants preservation - newsday zimbabwe chitungwiza-based visual artist joshua chirume explores various characteristics of his totem animal, the elephant and engraves them into highly expressive and realistic fine art stone figurines. a visit and conversation with chirume at his chitungwiza arts centre workplace and exhibition garden revealed that elephants, especially from the african savannah, are the largest land animals in the world, which can run and swim for long distances. his carvings show many postures of elephant tusks in either browsing, grazing, debarking trees, walking, destroying and/or swimming positions. there are three types of elephants, namely the african savannah (bush), african forest and the asian. chirume’s passion for carving elephants carries the day for someone who recognises world elephant day, celebrated annually on august 12. usually, the day is used to rally people to support organisations that are working to stop illegal poaching and trade of elephant ivory and other wildlife products, protect wild elephant habitat and provide sanctuaries and alternative habitats for domesticated elephants to live freely. “this herd shows a family of elephants being led by its eldest member. the bull leads the family to grazing land and resting points, including protecting them from enemies,” chirume said. “elephants can travel for a long distance and may even cross borders. they eat a lot and often destroy fields.” chirume carves most of his works on springstone and a captivating feature of his carvings is his attention to detail. his elephant carvings try to impeccably recreate the jumbos’ hard bark skin. the carvings also bring out why leather products from the jumbos are quite expensive on the market. despite their hard skin, elephants fear bees and can sprint away from them, creating an interesting sight and ambience as they scurry to safety. in case someone happens to be in their way, they should be careful of a stampede. surprisingly, the huge animals cannot jump. some day, they may result in avalanches as land subsides each time they try to create their paths on the edges of mountains. “given . these carvings help children to develop a desire to visit nearby game parks one day in the future,” chirume said. “in addition to that, these carvings, when they are taken into homes or offices for decoration, complement other decorations to beautify the place. “elephants are preserved because they create economies through trophy hunting competitions. also, their meat and leather are equally expensive on the market. they are a good national investment because elephants can live up to 60 years if well taken care of.” an elephants is one of the easily remembered animals of the big five, a list which also includes lions, rhinos, buffalos and leopards. during commemorations to mark world elephants day sometime back, organised by the american embassy public affairs section, it was revealed that close to 90% of african elephants were killed by poachers and trophy hunters. the gathering resolved that children should be taught at infancy how to preserve natural resources and the wildlife that is around them. it is estimated that africa now only has about 415 000 elephants. chirume who, started carving in 2000, was taught by his brother josiah edmore chirume. he has also tried to carve groups of elephants or elephant families on hard stones",0

today n1 equals 0.38 cfa.due to its stable economy and prostitution being legal, although soliciting sex is not, ivory coast has become an attractive destination for sex work. some victims go on to become madams who source other girls, to recoup money they spent and to regain their own freedom.ivory coast and neighbouring countriesacross nigeria, recruiting agents go into rural communities or post in jobseekers’ groups on facebook, talking ambiguously about hustles that yield plenty of rewards and sending photographs of girls and women they have recruited to known madams.they coach recruits to tell immigration officials, who are sometimes aware of what is happening or simply don’t care enough to carry out proper scrutiny, that they are crossing the border to go to the nearby market in cotonou, an auxiliary port for nigeria.many recruits say agents, who have been known to be a relative, do not accompany them on the journey but pass their numbers to other agents who guide them across the porous borders. with no means of identification, they gain access by paying bribes of 1,000-2,000 cfa, sometimes paid ahead to the driver by the agents.view image in fullscreentiongoli is one of the small settlements in the forest where trafficked women are kept in makeshift brothels. photograph: eromo egbejuleunlike sara, most of the women and girls trafficked from nigeria live deep in the ivorian jungle, far from the eyes of the law.in tengréla, 7km (4.3 miles) from the malian border, there are several artisanal miner’s camps used by men from mali, burkina faso and guinea to earn money before returning to their countries. nigerian women and girls aged from about 14 to 38 also stay here in small settlements of makeshift tents made of black nylon held together with sticks.at the maquis – as the small bars are known in francophone africa – owned by madams in the settlements, both sets of immigrants fraternise, first publicly and then privately.“there is an odd belief in some of the gold mining regions that sex helps you find gold, which in turn [fuels] demand for sex trafficking,” says one former nigerian official who was previously stationed in ivory coast. “the cocoa [production] communities also have high sex demands to keep the men satisfied.”the guardian spoke to at least two dozen girls and women in the forest, some as young as 15. some of them said they had been starved for refusing to work or beaten up by angry patrons. many barely speak french and say they don’t know the country well enough to be able to escape.nigerian officials who have managed to repatriate girls trapped and exploited in the sex industry say they have seen children as young as 13 in the interior.“a lot of the girls we found claim to be over 18 and doing sex work of their own free will, but most of the time from their physical appearance, you know they are not,” says the former nigerian official. “tests to determine their age, such as scanning a wisdom tooth, cost about 50,000 cfa so you have to talk to them, but if they are insistent, you let them go back.”view image in fullscreenmany trafficked girls and women work in brothels in the forest near the malian border, used by migrant workers in mining camps. photograph: eromo egbejuleivory coast has a law criminalising trafficking, but it is barely enforced, and the country has been criticised by the us state department for its failure to tackle the problem.a cycle of debt, sex work and cocaine: the women in west africa caught in europe’s drugs trailthe escadron, a notorious ivorian police unit, has burned down some of the settlements where traffickers operate, but new ones keep springing up, partly because security personnel who come into the jungle allegedly demand weekly bribes of 1,000-2,000 cfa for each trafficked girl.view image in fullscreengirls who have escaped at the office of a nigerian community group in treichville, abidjan, ivory coast. photograph: eromo egbejuleadekoye vincent, spokesperson for the national agency for the prohibition of trafficking in persons (naptip) in nigeria, declined to comment when questioned about girls trapped and exploited in the sex industry in ivory coast. the ivorian national police and gendarmerie did not respond to requests for comment.for sara, the wait to return home goes on. she was in junior secondary school in port harcourt, in nigeria, before dropping out to travel to ivory coast. these days she is learning how to barter condoms for other items.“i really don’t",0
