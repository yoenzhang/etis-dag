"al wihda info it was during a punch operation, carried out by agents of the regional delegation of forests and wildlife of the center, in collaboration with the regional division of the judicial police, that the two alleged traffickers were arrested in yaounde. the two traffickers were apprehended in downtown yaoundé while trying to sell elephant tusks. they were found with two whole tusks and 12 huge pieces of ivory hidden among clothing in a suitcase. the elephant tusks weighed nearly 60 kg. the suspects were remanded to yaoundé-kondengui central prison. a wildlife law enforcement support organization (laga), provided technical assistance during this operation. according to a source who wished to remain anonymous, the two suspects belong to a vast network of traffickers which extends in the sub-region and as far as nigeria. they specialize in the trafficking of many wildlife species, including elephant tusks and feline skins. the source also added that the elephant tusks come from congo and the network uses heavy-duty storage crates to transport these wildlife products from one country to another. under the wildlife act 1994, anyone found at any time and anywhere, in possession of all or part of a protected species, is deemed to have killed the animal. strict enforcement of this law is therefore necessary to stem the extinction of elephants in the country and in the region. according to the international union for conservation of nature (iucn), the elephant population, particularly the african forest elephant, is in steep decline due to poaching. ofir drori, founding director of the eco activists for governance and law enforcement (eagle network) said the poaching situation in the sub-region is serious, especially in northern congo and south-eastern cameroon. this iconic animal faces a serious threat, due to its ivory, and is on the international union for conservation of nature (iucn) red list of threatened species. elephants play a very important role in our ecosystem and many environmental scientists say urgent action is needed, as iucn director general dr bruno oberle said: “we urgently need to put an end to poaching and ensure that we conserve adequate habitat, sufficient for forest and savannah elephants. several african countries have shown the way in recent years, proving that we can reverse the decline of elephants, and we must work together so that their example can be followed."" https://www.alwihdainfo.com/cameroun-deux-trafiquants-arretes-avec-pres-de-60-kg-d-ivoire-a-yaounde_a117118.html",1
"an adjutant of the national gendarmerie and a sergeant of the congolese armed forces were arrested for ivory trafficking (illegal possession of ivory tusks) during an operation which saw the dismantling of a network of suspected ivory traffickers. four civilians, members of this network, were also arrested during an operation carried out by elements of the national gendarmerie. the six alleged traffickers who make up the network were arrested successively on january 27, 28, 31 and february 2, 2021 in pointe-noire, the economic capital of the republic of congo. this series of arrests was carried out with the support of agents from the departmental directorate of forest economy of pointe noire and palf (support project for the application of the law on wildlife). this punch operation allowed the seizure of four (4) ivory tusks, weighing 101.3 kg, representing approximately four (4) slaughtered elephants, several objects worked in ivory namely 20 sticks, 15 pendants, 04 round bracelets, 02 chopsticks with balls. initially, four individuals were arrested, including two on 27 january [2021] and the other two on 28 january 2021 with an ivory tusk. the investigations into this case led to the arrest of two other members of this network. the adjutant was arrested on january 31, 2021 with two (2) ivory tusks and the sergeant arrested with an ivory tusk on february 2, 2021. this soldier of the congolese armed forces confessed to having used his service weapon to shoot down an elephant in the forest of the district of banda in the department of niari. the other five are being prosecuted for the offenses of illegal possession, circulation and marketing of the seized ivory tusks. note that the arrested gendarme is also a sculptor and sells products worked in ivory. these alleged wildlife offenders, all of congolese nationality, have all admitted the facts with which they are accused. they are said to be familiar with the illegal trade in wildlife products in the town of pointe noire. the ivory seized is believed to come from the villages of konongo in the department of kouilou and ngokosso in the district of banda, department of niari. the latter will answer for their acts before the congolese justice and risk sentences of up to five years of imprisonment and 5 million fcfa in fines, each. the illegal trade in wildlife products is leading to the extinction of wildlife species around the world. this illegal trafficking is the third most profitable form of trade after drugs and weapons. recall that the elephant enjoys absolute protection in the republic of the congo following the 1991 decree as well as an act of the sovereign national conference. the species is threatened with extinction in many places in congo due to poaching for its spikes. article 27 of the congolese law on the protection of this wildlife species states: ""the importation https://groupecongomedias.com/demantelement-dun-reseau-majeur-de-presumes-trafiquants-divoire-a-pointe-noire-un-adjudant-et-un-sergent-aux-arrets/?fbclid=iwar18k39kctinrmczsclmduzosgfvka97rfqbbjlh2rn8kcdhys5b84-pu8g",1

"justice.gov a fredericksburg man pleaded guilty today to the unlawful sale of endangered species, including elephant and whale ivory. according to court documents, gary l. cooper, 60, operated online storefronts to sell elephant and whale ivory, all in violation of the endangered species act. from at least june 2015 through early 2020, cooper used online platforms, such as craigslist and ebay, to list for sale individual carvings made in whole, or in part, from ivory. these items ranged in size, including two raw elephant tusks that measured at least 28 inches long. in addition to several raw and carved tusks, the advertisements offered numerous elephant ivory carvings and both raw and scrimshawed sperm whale teeth. cooper told his clients, including an undercover agent, that he was selling off an estate belonging to an elderly couple in poor health, when in reality he was regularly buying ivory online and flipping the pieces for profit. over about a sixteen-month period beginning in september 2018, cooper did business with united states fish and wildlife service (usfws) undercover agents by selling or offering for sale no less than 50 pieces of elephant ivory, with a total market value between $40,000 and $95,000. during their correspondence, cooper and the undercover agents discussed the illegality of buying and selling ivory across state lines. on november 17, 2018, cooper offered to sell to an undercover usfws special agent multiple ivory pieces for a total cost of $8,125. on november 26, 2018, cooper sold two pieces of carved elephant ivory to the undercover agent and mailed the items from virginia to new york. upon forensic investigation, the items were confirmed to be genuine elephant ivory. cooper is scheduled to be sentenced on august 31. as part of the plea, cooper will forfeit approximately 136 pieces of raw and carved ivory. he faces a maximum penalty of 1 year in prison. actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum penalties. a federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the u.s. sentencing guidelines and other statutory factors. raj parekh, acting u.s. attorney for the eastern district of virginia, and ryan noel, special agent-in-charge, united states fish and wildlife service, office of law enforcement, made the announcement after u.s. magistrate judge john f. anderson accepted the plea. this investigation was conducted by the united states fish and wildlife service, office of law enforcement, with assistance from the virginia department of wildlife resources. assistant u.s. attorney gordon kromberg and special assistant u.s. attorneys alejandra arias and sara hallmark are prosecuting the case. https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/pr/man-pleads-guilty-violating-endangered-species-act",1

"tanzania has seized ivory tusks equivalent to killing at least 117 elephants, its tourism minister said, part of its drive to stamp out organized criminal networks involved in years of industrial-scale poaching. the elephant population in tanzania, famed for its wildlife reserves, shrank from 110,000 in 2009 to barely 43,000 in 2014, according to a 2015 census, with conservation groups blaming rampant poaching. the government says numbers have now started to recover. demand for ivory from asian countries such as china and vietnam, where it is turned into jewels and ornaments, has driven the surge in poaching across africa. hamisi kigwangalla, minister for natural resources and tourism, said on his twitter account late on wednesday the ivory was recovered after authorities arrested suspected “hardcore” poacher hassan shaban likwema, also known by the alias hassan nyoni. “the arrest of nyoni has brought us to a stage where we can say we have taken into custody all the hardcore poachers on our wanted list, except for a few who have left the country,” kigwangalla said. “nyoni and his accomplices’ consignment is worth 4 billion shillings ($1.74 million) and involved the killing of 117 elephants going back to 2015 and earlier,” he said. neither likwema nor his accomplices were immediately reachable for comment. tanzania has seized ivory tusks equivalent to killing at least 117 elephants, its tourism minister said, part of its drive to stamp out organized criminal networks involved in years of industrial-scale poaching. the elephant population in tanzania, famed for its wildlife reserves, shrank from 110,000 in 2009 to barely 43,000 in 2014, according to a 2015 census, with conservation groups blaming rampant poaching. the government says numbers have now started to recover. demand for ivory from asian countries such as china and vietnam, where it is turned into jewels and ornaments, has driven the surge in poaching across africa. hamisi kigwangalla, minister for natural resources and tourism, said on his twitter account late on wednesday the ivory was recovered after authorities arrested suspected “hardcore” poacher hassan shaban likwema, also known by the alias hassan nyoni. “the arrest of nyoni has brought us to a stage where we can say we have taken into custody all the hardcore poachers on our wanted list, except for a few who have left the country,” kigwangalla said. “nyoni and his accomplices’ consignment is worth 4 billion shillings ($1.74 million) and involved the killing of 117 elephants going back to 2015 and earlier,” he said. neither likwema nor his accomplices were immediately reachable for comment. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tanzania-poaching/tanzania-seizes-ivory-tusks-equivalent-to-117-elephants-killed-iduskcn1vq13v https://nypost.com/2019/09/05/tanzania-seizes-ivory-tusks-equivalent-to-killing-117-elephants/ https://www.mwananchi.co.tz/habari/kitaifa/vipande-338--vya-meno-ya-tembo-vyakamatwa-dar-/1597296-5260894-3k73bnz/index.html https://twitter.com/hkigwangalla/status/1169536186521702401",1
